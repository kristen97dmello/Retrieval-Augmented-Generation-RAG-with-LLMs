Mission \\nTo create a transformative educational experience for students focused on deep disciplinary \\nknowledge; problem solving; leadership, communication, and interpersonal skills; and personal \\nhealth and well-being. To cultivate a transformative university community committed to (a) attracting and retaining \\ndiverse, world-class talent; (b) creating a collaborative environment open to the free exchange of \\nideas, where research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish; and (c) ensuring \\nindividuals can achieve their full potential. To impact society in a transformative way — regionally, nationally, and globally — by engaging \\nwith partners outside the traditional borders of the university campus. ', '5 \\n \\n \\nCarnegie Mellon Code \\n \\nStudents at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated \\nto the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, \\nethical and moral conduct possible. These standards require personal integrity, a commitment \\nto honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place \\nthe good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be \\nmet, commitments kept. As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the \\nstandards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is \\nrare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect \\nthe community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply. The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a \\ncommitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the \\ncreativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community \\ncannot exist. The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to \\nthe high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that \\nrespect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should \\nvoluntarily withdraw from the University.

is a private university incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of \\nPennsylvania. Its first purpose, as stated in its Articles of Incorporation, is: \\n\"...the establishment and maintenance in the City of Pittsburgh of a coeducational university of \\nhigher education, including an institute of technology, emphasizing liberal-professional \\neducation and specializing in teaching and research programs in selected areas of importance to \\nthe community and to the nation.\" \\nMore specifically, Carnegie Mellon seeks to provide education of the highest quality so that all \\nstudents will be prepared to achieve their potential as professional persons and as thoughtful, \\nwell-informed individuals. In addition, the university encourages and supports scholarship, \\nresearch and artistic production, both as essential components of its educational program and \\nin fulfillment of the special role of an academic institution as a source of new knowledge and \\nunderstanding. Through scholarship, research and the men and women it educates, the \\nuniversity contributes to social progress. As a private university, Carnegie Mellon is free to set its own measures of excellence and to \\ndetermine its own educational objectives. By carefully exercising the freedom to select limited \\nareas for university effort, it can preserve its ability to be innovative and creative in response to \\nthe changing needs of society. In order to maintain this independence and flexibility, Carnegie \\nMellon depends upon the voluntary support of the society which it serves. It depends especially \\nfor its funds upon students and their families, alumni, trustees, foundations, corporations, \\ngovernment and friends. Thus, it is of the utmost importance that the goals of the university be \\nclear and that the standards and procedures for the conduct of its affairs be well understood by \\nall of its constituents, both on and off campus. These appear in detail in the duly promulgated \\nregulations of the university, particularly in the catalogs, the Student Handbook and the Faculty \\nHandbook. Academic and Individual Freedom \\nWithin the academic community, trustees, administrators, faculty, students and staff share the \\nresponsibility for achievement of the goals of the university. Responsibilities specific to various \\ngroups are discussed in the sections which follow. Especially important, however, are the \\nresponsibilities pertaining to academic and individual freedom. An academic community is \\nuniquely suited to its educational and scholarly purposes primarily because of its firm \\ncommitment to intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry and expression, respect for the dignity \\nof each individual and because of its receptiveness to constructive change. ', \"10 \\n \\n \\nThe commitment to academic and individual freedom carries with it major responsibilities for all \\nmembers of the university. In exercising their own freedoms, they must respect the rights of \\nothers. In seeking innovation, they must recognize that constructive change can be affected at a \\nuniversity only through orderly and rational processes. Intentional acts threatening personal \\nsafety, malicious destruction of property or willful and substantial disruption of university \\nfunctions have no place in an academic community and will not be tolerated. It is the \\nresponsibility of all members of the academic community to maintain an atmosphere in which \\nsuch violations of rights are unlikely to occur and to develop processes which assure the \\nprotection of these rights for all persons. Board of Trustees \\nThe trustees bear ultimate responsibility for the university, its policies, organization, financing \\nand governance. Two direct responsibilities are the supervision of the university's finances \\nand the appointment of the president as chief executive officer. The operating \\nresponsibilities and the authority to act are delegated to the president; and it is primarily \\nthrough the president that the trustees monitor the university's activities. Administration \\nThe administrative officers are formally responsible for supervising the programs and \\nenforcing the policies of the university, for assessing the effects of policy and for \\nrecommending improvements or changes where appropriate. The president is the chief \\nexecutive officer of the university. In the operation of the university, the president delegates \\nresponsibility to provost, vice presidents, deans, directors and department heads and to \\nvarious councils and committees, which may include faculty, students and staff. It is the duty of the administrative officers of the university to maintain a campus climate \\nwhich enhances the freedom of the faculty to teach, to engage in research and to take part in \\nother scholarly and artistic activities, and the freedom of the students to learn and grow both \\ninside and outside of the classroom. Faculty \\nThe faculty has the primary responsibility for carrying out the educational and scholarly \\nprograms of the university. All members of the faculty have the duty to conduct their courses in a manner consistent \\nwith the highest standards of their profession. Through the presentation of material in the \\n\", \"11 \\n \\n \\nclassroom, they should strive to advance the art of teaching. One of the primary goals should \\nbe to instill in their students a desire to learn and an enthusiasm for the subject matter at \\nhand. The faculty as a whole also has the major responsibility for establishing and \\nmaintaining curricula which meet the standards and fulfill the educational goals of the \\nuniversity. Students \\nCarnegie Mellon, as a private university, selects from among its applicants those students \\nwho have demonstrated the qualifications for achieving professional competence in one of \\nthe fields in which the university offers instruction. Any student who meets its standards is \\nwelcome to apply for admission and, if admitted, to remain at the university so long as he or \\nshe abides by its rules. Advisory Boards \\nEach academic department and school at Carnegie Mellon, as well as some non-academic \\nunits, has an advisory board whose purpose is to assist the department and the university \\nmore effectively to carry out their mission. An advisory board may use any appropriate \\nmeans to achieve this purpose, important among which are evaluating the department's \\ngoals and directions and providing information and advice to the president, provost, deans \\nand department heads. Statement on Academic Integrity \\nThe Statement on Academic Integrity, found in the faculty, student and staff handbooks, is the \\nfirst step in Carnegie Mellon University's ongoing effort to identify and implement the kind of \\nsociety its members wish to enjoy. This statement will be followed by implementation strategies as the Task Force on Academic \\nIntegrity continues its work. Please visit the Academic Integrity website for additional information and resources. Statement on Academic Integrity \\nCarnegie Mellon is a self-governing institution that requires ethical behavior of its \\nadministration, faculty, staff and students that goes beyond simple compliance with the law. Respect for these requirements creates a moral authority for the university to insist upon \\n\", \"12 \\n \\n \\nappropriate behavior. This authority is essential to the accomplishment of the university's \\nmission. Integrity as described in this statement is a defining feature of the university \\ncommunity's high expectations for the conduct of its members. Introduction \\nCarnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve \\nsociety with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and \\nexpressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the \\nchanging needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: \\nto create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, \\nteaching and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching them leadership \\nand problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society \\nand commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open \\nto the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish. These statements provide groundwork for academic integrity that includes everyone in the \\nCarnegie Mellon community. Our common objective is to make sure that we teach and learn \\nwith commitment, consistency, honesty and fidelity. This process involves at its core \\ninteraction between young and old, novice and expert, apprentice and master. Integrity \\nrequires that we examine the context in which we do our work. In the university community, \\nyoung people grow and develop their identities, which mandate that all our dealings follow \\nand foster principles of respect for autonomy, beneficence, justice and fidelity to the mission \\nof the university. The university population is increasingly diverse, faces rapid changes in \\nknowledge and technology that have historically produced uncertainty about the appropriate \\nroles of individuals and professions in the larger society. Each of these facts can and do \\ncreate issues that we need to be aware of and deal with if we are to successfully achieve our \\nprimary missions. When these circumstances are not fully communicated to and understood \\nby all persons in the community, unnecessary suspicions concerning integrity may distract \\nfrom our teaching and learning and taint the atmosphere on campus. When they are openly \\ndiscussed and conflicts concerning them openly aired, we all proceed with greater confidence \\nand trust. All members of the university community have the obligation to serve as models of personal \\nand professional integrity, as well as models for creating, expressing and transferring \\nknowledge. This implies that the faculty not only provide the knowledge and training that \\nprepare students to find their productive roles in society, but also help them discover and \\nmaintain integrity in the practice of that role. Staff and administrators are charged with \\nrepresenting the university accurately and forthrightly. Students are responsible for \\n\", '13 \\n \\n \\nconducting their learning in a similarly honest and committed fashion-by avoiding plagiarism, \\ncheating or taking credit for work not their own-and thus contributing to a campus \\natmosphere which expects and supports academic integrity. Practice of the Mission of Academic Integrity \\nAcademic integrity refers to the implicit commitment that every member makes to all others \\nin the community to practice those principles that underlie the mission of the university and \\ndefine academic integrity. These are: honesty and good faith; clarity in the communication of \\ncore values; professional conduct of work; mutual trust and respect; and fairness and \\nexemplary behavior. Honesty and Good Faith \\nUnderlying all the interactions and transactions of the university is the assumption that all of \\nits members act in good faith and are open with each other. For example, students must be \\nable to assume that they can take faculty, staff and administration at their word and vice \\nversa. If questions about honest communications and good faith arise within the community \\nor among some of its members, the general issue must be aired in a frank and open way. Individual cases involving alleged infractions, on the other hand, are properly handled under \\nconditions that respect confidentiality. Penalties for proven infractions of the university\\'s \\nstandards must be dealt with promptly and fairly. The more fully we can come to understand \\nand concur with one another on guiding principles, the fewer such cases will turn up, and the \\nmore rewarding the university experience will be for all of us. Clarity in the Communication of Core Values \\nClarity in the communication of the core values and standards of Carnegie Mellon requires \\nexplicit understanding of the mission and core values among members of faculty, staff, \\nadministration and students; reflection upon and open discussion of standards of practice; \\nidentification and resolution of conflicts posed by our mission objectives; and a clear and \\nopen communication of our mission to the community. This means we recognize our \\ncommitment to the distinct objectives of our vision and mission with all the assessment, \\ncertification, evaluation and reorientation that these imply. In direct face-to-face situations \\nstudents should be dealt with immediately, openly and honestly. Students also need \\nopportunities to learn about and discuss standards, expectations and norms when no \\nimmediate \"case\" is at hand. ', '14 \\n \\n \\nProfessional Conduct of Work \\nProfessionalism for the faculty involves designing syllabi which accurately indicate the subject \\nmatter and practices of each course and meeting all scheduled classes fully prepared for the \\nassigned work. It also involves the certification of students in their areas of expertise. The \\nuniversity is obligated to provide measures of student progress in the form of grades, \\ndegrees, and honors. These attest to society that both faculty and students have fulfilled their \\ncommitments. Degrees and honors certify that a level of performance has been met in a \\nstudent\\'s demonstration of acquisition and use of knowledge, so it is imperative that grading \\nbe a fair, accurate and honest measure of a student\\'s work. At the same time, faculty need to \\nbe cognizant of the pressure on students to view grades, which they see as determining their \\njob prospects, as \"the be all and end all\" of their university experiences and to devise \\nstrategies in the classroom to make learning, rather than receiving grades, the central focus. The ethics governing research must be understood, practiced and communicated to \\nstudents. This involves being clear and truthful about the ownership of research results and \\ndata, avoiding conflicts of interest (or disclosing them when they cannot be avoided), and \\nmaking only honest and accurate claims in reporting research. In the context of the \\nuniversity, the professional conduct of work has two distinct dimensions: professionalism in \\none\\'s discipline or area of expertise and professionalism as a member of the university. The \\ndistinction between these aspects of professionalism in the academy must be clearly \\nunderstood and communicated. In addition, each of the various academic disciplines and \\nfields of endeavor represented at Carnegie Mellon has its own implicit and explicit standards \\nfor professional work. These are binding on faculty, administration and staff, and must be \\ncommunicated to students as part of their preparation to become professionals. Research \\nethics also entails the open discussion of the propriety of the university\\'s involvement in \\nwork that seems to be detrimental to society given the values of our mission. Professional research in the academy is involved with several of its unique institutional goals, \\nincluding the education of undergraduates, graduate education and certification for \\nprofessional roles, and faculty tenure. These features pose issues specific to the academy, \\nissues which must be acknowledged and treated explicitly if we are to be clear, open and \\nconsistent. The practices of other organizations may therefore not be entirely relevant to \\nthose in the university. Recognizing that students are learners demands that they be involved \\nin ongoing research in ways which benefit their education, rather than merely as assistants in \\nfaculty projects. Students need also to be clearly informed about standards of behavior and \\nperformance that are accepted practices in the discipline and held responsible to them. This \\nshould be done proactively as a learning experience rather than retroactively as a punitive \\nexperience. ', \"15 \\n \\n \\nMutual Trust and Respect \\nAn environment of mutual trust and respect is necessary if the institution is to promote \\nintegrity. Mutual trust and respect are prerequisites for open communication and honest \\ndialogue about values, goals and expectations. They require freedom of expression without \\nfear of retribution, institutional or otherwise, and value the diversity of persons, ideas and \\nchoices differing from one's own. They recognize that being in a diverse community is an \\nadvantage to encouraging discovery and creativity. Both respect for individuals and respect \\nfor institutional values involves balancing the claims of personal autonomy with the goals \\nand mission of the institution. All of us need to be alert to prevent the power structure of the \\nclassroom and the university as a whole from suppressing legitimate beliefs and practices. If \\ntrust should break down, we need to explore the reasons for the breakdown and identify \\nways for the community to rebuild trust among its members. A basis for promoting trust and respect is provided by ensuring that the faculty treat the \\nstudent's education and the student as ends rather than as a means to some end. For \\nexample, the graduate student's development as a researcher and professional, his or her \\nlearning and well-being, have to be honored as ends in themselves, rather than treating \\ngraduate student work merely as a means to the end of the production of knowledge (from \\nwhich the professor may benefit more than the student). Students at all levels must be \\nencouraged to value their university experience as learning and personal growth, rather than \\nsolely as the means to a career goal. They are responsible for rendering an atmosphere of \\nmistrust by their teachers and among themselves unnecessary by consistently living up to \\nthe university's standards. Fairness and Exemplary Behavior \\nThe preservation of academic integrity means not only commitment to ideals but also justice \\nin carrying out these ideals. Faculty, staff and administration must deal fairly in all of the \\nvarious decisions they make which have consequences for students and all the other \\nstakeholders of the university. When questions arise as to whether such decisions distribute \\nbenefits and burdens fairly, significant dialogue and open communications about such \\ndecisions should be conducted. The power that teachers wield in the classroom must be \\nexercised with the greatest possible care for maintaining fairness, which means examining \\nclassroom practice for any hidden assumptions which might produce confusion or partiality. It also means that we describe to students what the expected commitment for a learning \\nenvironment is and how to deal with conflicts of commitment, for example time \\nmanagement problems, as they arise. Students must strive to be fair to each other, for \\nexample in not claiming unjustified credit in carrying out joint projects and in the appropriate \\n\", '16 \\n \\n \\nsharing of facilities. Staff must demonstrate impartiality in offering students information, \\nopportunities and perquisites. Integrity in the campus community is more than just swift punishment of plagiarism or \\ncheating. It is an on-going process which asks everyone to both consider carefully and \\npractice consistently the honesty, clear thinking, professionalism, fairness and trust that \\nmake learning, teaching and living here rewarding. When misunderstandings or conflicts over \\nwhat constitutes integrity arise, as they may in a changing society, the campus must use the \\nopportunity to exercise impartiality and wisdom to adjudicate between ideas and parties. Rightly settled, such issues will become the basis for shared understandings in the future.', 'The university expects its members to be leaders in matters concerning integrity, not only \\nhere, but in the larger society we serve. Standards for Academic & Creative Life (Academic Policies) \\nThis section of The Word serves to highlight many policies and procedures related to academics \\nat Carnegie Mellon University. You should also become familiar with the following sources, \\nwhich are the primary documents governing academic policies: the University Policies website, \\nthe Undergraduate Catalog, and individual department handbooks provided to each graduate \\nstudent. Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview \\nAcademic disciplinary actions are outcomes imposed when any student violates the \\nUniversity Policy on Academic Integrity including cheating, plagiarism and unauthorized \\nassistance. Academic Integrity Policy  \\nStudents at Carnegie Mellon are engaged in intellectual activity consistent with the highest \\nstandards of the academy. The relationship between students and instructors and their \\nshared commitment to overarching standards of respect, honor and transparency determine \\nthe integrity of our community of scholars. The actions of our students, faculty and staff are a \\nrepresentation of our university community and of the professional and personal \\ncommunities that we lead. Therefore, a deep and abiding commitment to academic integrity \\nis fundamental to a Carnegie Mellon education. Honesty and good faith, clarity in the \\ncommunication of core values, professional conduct of work, mutual trust and respect, and \\n', '17 \\n \\n \\nfairness and exemplary behavior represent the expectations for ethical behavior for all \\nmembers of the Carnegie Mellon community. Policy Statement \\nIn any manner of presentation, it is the responsibility of each student to produce her/his \\nown original academic work. Collaboration or assistance on academic work to be graded \\nis not permitted unless explicitly authorized by the course instructor(s). Students may \\nutilize the assistance provided by the Student Academic Success Center and the Academic \\nResource Center (CMU-Q) unless specifically prohibited by the course instructor(s). Any \\nother sources of collaboration or assistance must be specifically authorized by the course \\ninstructor(s). In all academic work to be graded, the citation of all sources is required. When \\ncollaboration or assistance is permitted by the course instructor(s) or when a student \\nutilizes the services provided by the Student Academic Success Center and the Academic \\nResource Center (CMU-Q), the acknowledgement of any collaboration or assistance is \\nlikewise required. This citation and acknowledgement must be incorporated into the work \\nsubmitted and not separately or at a later point in time. Failure to do so is dishonest and \\nis subject to disciplinary action. Instructors have a duty to communicate their expectations including those specific to \\ncollaboration, assistance, citation and acknowledgement within each course. Students \\nlikewise have a duty to ensure that they understand and abide by the standards that \\napply in any course or academic activity. In the absence of such understanding, it is the \\nstudent’s responsibility to seek additional information and clarification. Policy Violations \\nCheating occurs when a student avails her/himself of an unfair or disallowed advantage \\nwhich includes but is not limited to: \\n1. Theft of or unauthorized access to an exam, answer key or other graded work from \\nprevious course offerings. 2. Use of an alternate, stand-in or proxy during an examination. 3. Copying from the examination or work of another person or source. 4. Submission or use of falsified data. 5. Using false statements to obtain additional time or other accommodation. ', '18 \\n \\n \\n6. Falsification of academic credentials. Plagiarism is defined as the use of work or concepts contributed by other individuals \\nwithout proper attribution or citation. Unique ideas or materials taken from another \\nsource for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged in academic work to be \\ngraded. Examples of sources expected to be referenced include but are not limited to: \\n1. Text, either written or spoken, quoted directly or paraphrased. 2. Graphic elements. 3. Passages of music, existing either as sound or as notation. 4. Mathematical proofs. 5. Scientific data. 6. Concepts or material derived from the work, published or unpublished, of another \\nperson. Unauthorized assistance refers to the use of sources of support that have not been \\nspecifically authorized in this policy statement or by the course instructor(s) in the \\ncompletion of academic work to be graded. Such sources of support may include but are \\nnot limited to advice or help provided by another individual, published or unpublished \\nwritten sources, and electronic sources. Examples of unauthorized assistance include but \\nare not limited to: \\n1. Collaboration on any assignment beyond the standards authorized by this policy \\nstatement and the course instructor(s). 2. Submission of work completed or edited in whole or in part by another person. 3. Supplying or communicating unauthorized information or materials, including \\ngraded work and answer keys from previous course offerings, in any way to another \\nstudent. 4. Use of unauthorized information or materials, including graded work and answer \\nkeys from previous course offerings. 5. Use of unauthorized devices. 6. Submission for credit of previously completed graded work in a second course \\nwithout first obtaining permission from the instructor(s) of the second course. In the \\ncase of concurrent courses, permission to submit the same work for credit in two \\ncourses must be obtained from the instructors of both courses. ', '19 \\n \\n \\n \\nProcedures for dealing with allegations of these policy violations are detailed in the \\nuniversity’s Academic Disciplinary Action Procedures, which are published in The WORD \\nstudent handbook. Periodic review of these procedures will be overseen by the Dean of \\nStudent Affairs or her/his designee in consultation with Faculty Senate and the relevant \\nstudent governing bodies. Any amendments to these procedures are subject to the \\napproval of Faculty Senate. Additional guidelines and procedures for graduate students \\nmay exist at the college/department/program level, in which case they are communicated \\nin the college/department/program graduate student handbook. Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities \\nQualified individuals are entitled to reasonable accommodations under the guidelines of the \\nRehabilitation Act of 1973 and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The Office of Disability \\nResources serves as links between students with disabilities and the campus community. Accommodations are determined on a case-by-case basis. In order to receive \\nservices/accommodations verification of a disability is required as recommended in writing \\nby a doctor, licensed psychologist or psycho-educational specialist. All information will be \\nconsidered confidential and only released to appropriate personnel on a need to know basis. To access services, individuals must initiate a request in writing for specific \\nservices/accommodations (books on tape, enlargements, interpreters, etc.). The university \\nmakes available Summary of Accommodations memoranda for students to give to \\nprofessors, which document disability and describe the accommodations. Accommodations \\nprescribed only apply to Carnegie Mellon and may not be valid elsewhere. The individual \\ntakes full responsibility for ongoing assistance. For more information or to initiate a request \\nfor accommodations, please contact Catherine Getchell.

It is the student's responsibility to provide \\nEnrollment Services and the university with a current address. Computing Policy \\nStatement \\nThe purpose of this policy is to set forth guidelines so that members of our community \\nmay use the campus network and computing facilities in ways that are responsible and \\nrespectful of privacy. This policy sets forth the university’s expectations of acceptable \\nbehavior on the part of computer systems users at Carnegie Mellon by providing \\nguidelines for appropriate use of computing and related communication systems and \\nexamples of inappropriate use. These standards of acceptable behavior also extend \\nbeyond the campus community into the Internet. Just as it is unacceptable to violate \\nothers’ rights to privacy, property and resources within Carnegie Mellon, it is also \\nunacceptable to violate those rights on systems that are not at Carnegie Mellon but are \\naccessible through Carnegie Mellon’s connection to the Internet. This policy applies to all users of Carnegie Mellon computing systems, including students, \\nfaculty and staff, and any others granted the use of university computing resources. It \\napplies to the use of all computing facilities owned, leased, operated or contracted by \\nCarnegie Mellon University. As used in this policy, terms such as “computing,” \\n“computing/communications systems,” “computing resources,” etc., refer to all computers, \\ncommunication systems, and peripherals, software, telephones and systems with similar \\n\", '21 \\n \\n \\nfunctions, which are owned by Carnegie Mellon, or which utilize Carnegie Mellon \\ninfrastructure such as telephone lines or computer networks. Although this policy does not attempt to deal specifically with legal issues, university \\nmembers are responsible to act in compliance with the law, including any federal, state \\nand local laws governing computer and telecommunications use, as well as all other \\napplicable university policies. Privileges and Responsibilities \\nEvery member of the Carnegie Mellon community who uses computing and related \\ncommunications systems at Carnegie Mellon, or systems that belong to Carnegie Mellon \\nor which rely on Carnegie Mellon’s infrastructure has the responsibilities described in this \\npolicy. This includes members of the Carnegie Mellon community who have restricted \\nprivileges, such as alumni who may have electronic mail access only. Individuals with \\npersonally-owned computers, but who rely upon the university network to connect those \\ncomputers (either through an on-campus or remote network connection, such as ethernet \\nor wireless) are expected to abide by the policies set forth in this document. Personally-\\nowned computers operating in stand-alone mode or networked through a non-university \\nconnection are not covered under this policy, but those users are encouraged to consult \\nthe usage policies set forth by their Internet Service Provider. A fundamental premise of this policy is that anyone sharing computing resources with \\nother individuals should behave as a reasonable, mature and ethical person. The user \\nmust recognize that computer systems and networks do not exist in a special \\nenvironment; on the contrary, use of computers is a form of communication, and every \\ncomponent of a computing environment and every piece of information it contains belong \\nto the university, the university community as a whole, or some individual or group within \\nthat community. Access to Carnegie Mellon’s computing resources is contingent upon being a member of \\nthe university community and adhering to university and Computing Services policies, \\nguidelines and procedures, including this policy. Misuse may result in the loss of access \\nand/or university disciplinary action. For some users and certain systems, access may be \\nauthorized by specific departments, research centers or other organizations affiliated with \\nCarnegie Mellon. In such cases, any department- or group-specific policies and guidelines \\nmust be adhered to when using resources provided by the department or group. This is in \\naddition to university policies and Computing Services guidelines and procedures. Any user who suspects a violation of the university’s computer use policies, or who has \\nknowledge of potential vulnerabilities or security loopholes in a system or network at \\n', '22 \\n \\n \\nCarnegie Mellon, should immediately notify the Information Security Office at iso-\\nir@andrew.cmu.edu. Maintain the Security and Confidentiality of your Account \\nUsers assume personal responsibility for the use made of their computer accounts. This \\nresponsibility begins with selecting a secure password, and involves maintaining the \\nconfidentiality of that password and changing the password regularly in order to assure \\nthe continued security of your account. For guidance in selecting a secure password, see \\nGuidelines for Password Management. If you believe that someone has made \\nunauthorized use of your account, you should change your password immediately and \\nreport the incident to the Information Security Office. Respect for Others’ Property and Privacy Rights \\nUsers are responsible to respect copyright agreements and intellectual property \\nownership. Any material that is the work of another, whether explicitly copyrighted or not, \\nshould not be distributed by any user without appropriate acknowledgement and/or \\npermission of the creator. Unless permission has been granted by the owner of copyright \\nprotected materials, distribution of copyright protected material via the university \\nnetwork or computer systems is prohibited. While the university has been granted \\npermission by software vendors to distribute certain software packages via the network, it \\nis not generally permissible for individual users to distribute that same software to others \\nvia the university network or computer systems. See the sections in this policy on Misuse \\nand Inappropriate Behavior. While there may be cases in which property rights to \\nparticular programs, data, etc., are ambiguous or in dispute, the user must assume that \\nany information not created by himself or herself belongs to someone else and must \\nrespect that person’s privacy and property rights to that information. (In certain \\nsituations, even information created by the user may not belong to that user but rather to \\nthe university or others.) This policy is not intended to limit “fair use” as permitted under \\nthe Copyright Act and users having questions about whether a particular use constitutes a \\n“fair use” may consult the Office of the General Counsel for advice. Improper/Illegal Communications  \\nAny communications that would be improper or illegal on any other medium are equally \\nso on the computer: libelous material, obscene messages, harassment, forgery, threats, \\netc. However, this is not intended to restrict the free expression of ideas. Communication \\nconducted in accordance with the university policy on Freedom of Expression and with \\nthe statement on Academic Freedom and Responsibility enunciated in the Appointment \\nand Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon University will not be considered a violation of this \\n', '23 \\n \\n \\npolicy. For further guidelines, see also the university policy on Separation of Individual’s \\nand Institution’s Interests. Responsible Sharing of Resources  \\nWhere a resource such as memory, CPU time or access to network resources belongs to \\nthe whole community collectively, it must be shared. It is unacceptable to make such excessive use of system or network resources that other \\nusers cannot obtain access. Examples include excessive use of CPU time during a period \\nof heavy use on a timesharing system, excessive use of disk space on a system that does \\nnot limit such utilization, the use of an excessive amount of network bandwidth in an \\nenvironment of networked computers, and any activity that makes a system unusable or \\nsignificantly degrades performance for others. A novice user might be unaware that a \\nparticular action constitutes “excessive use” but, without doubt, once a system \\nadministrator makes him or her aware of the fact that such an action is unreasonable, \\nthat user will be held responsible for any further such infractions. If you are unsure \\nwhether your needs constitute excessive use, contact the system administrator. Similarly, \\nif you need an unusual amount of disk space, CPU time or other resources, check with the \\nsystem administrator to find out whether this use can be accommodated, rather than risk \\ninterfering with the work of others on the system. Risks of Data Loss and Data Persistence  \\nAlthough the university will make efforts to secure the network and university controlled \\nservers from abuse and damage, it cannot guarantee against data loss by a student, \\nfaculty, member or staff, either on a university-operated or an individually-owned \\ncomputer. Users should know that even those files that they have “deleted” using the appropriate \\nprocedures in the application or operating system, may indeed be recoverable if they exist \\nin a system backup file or other persistent form. If the university is asked to recover such \\ndata by subpoena, it must cooperate, and data that the user believes to have been \\ndestroyed may be recovered in the process. Personal Use  \\nWhile the university makes computer resources available primarily to achieve its goals of \\neducation and research, and for administrative activities, it realizes the need to encourage \\nthe personal use of computing for the convenience of the campus community. Thus, it is \\nreasonable to allow the use of computing resources for computer mail, document \\n', '24 \\n \\n \\npreparation, personal or course Web page publication, or other activity that can facilitate \\nconvenience or enhance productivity, to the extent that the activity is within the limits \\ndescribed by Responsible Sharing of Resources. Any personal use of computing resources \\nrelated to operating a personal business or commercial enterprise is prohibited unless \\npermission to do so has been specifically granted by the provost or the provost’s \\ndesignee. We do recognize the difficulty of distinguishing whether certain cases of “personal use” \\nare allowable, such as activities that result in personal financial gain (e.g. checking stock \\nprices online), relate to a commercial business (e.g. university-sponsored technology \\ntransfer efforts), or support (but do not constitute operating) a personal business (e.g. a \\nstudent developing a business plan or a faculty member writing a report for a consulting \\nengagement outside the university). In such cases, we rely on individuals to be \\nresponsible and judicious in the use of university’s shared computing resources. In \\nparticular ensuring: \\n• appropriate use of resources (e.g. any such work is completed outside of university \\ntime and does not utilize shared resources such as CPU cycles or network bandwidth \\nto a degree that adversely impacts academic or research activities); \\n• appropriate use of licenses (e.g. do not use software procured with academic use \\nlicenses for commercial applications or development, unless the license explicitly \\npermits such use); \\n• appropriate marketing (e.g. no creation of “.com” domains within Carnegie Mellon’s \\n“edu” domain, no advertising services and products using Carnegie Mellon email \\naccounts, and no advertising using web pages on Carnegie Mellon servers (any server \\nwith a .CMU.EDU host name). In cases of questionable personal use of resources, you may contact it-\\nhelp@andrew.cmu.edu to determine whether a particular activity is permissible. We reserve the right to restrict personal use of university systems and networks by an \\nindividual or by the community at large, if the use of resources for such activities becomes \\nexcessive. If you need unlimited access to computer networks for private or business \\npurposes, you can subscribe to a commercial service. For information regarding the use of resources to produce intellectual property and profit \\nfrom the development of such property see Carnegie Mellon University’s Intellectual \\nProperty Policy and the Policy on Conflict of Interest/Commitment. ', '25 \\n \\n \\nPrivacy \\nThe user must presume that the contents of any other users’ directory are private unless \\nexpressly designated otherwise, just as one would presume that the contents of \\nsomeone’s apartment or office are private. The only exceptions to this rule are: that in \\nsome environments, files such as “plan files” may be considered public even if the user \\nhas not expressly designated them as such; and that some services such as web pages \\nand anonymous or “guest access” ftp services may be considered to be public, but only for \\nthose areas not protected by password and which are “obviously” public. An unprotected \\naccount or shared device (such as a shared disk on a networked computer) are not \\nconsidered to be public unless the name or service expressly indicates that it is. In such \\ncases, any files or other data which would appear to be private in nature, by virtue of the \\nfile name or data stored, even if “publicly accessible” should be considered to be private. The user accessing such files has a responsibility to ask the owner of the files or service if \\nthe files are intended to be publicly accessible before the user does more than a “cursory \\nglance” sufficient to cause the question. A user can explicitly grant access to his or her directories, files or to services run from his \\nor her systems. However, users who issue general or vague invitations to browse through \\ntheir files incur a special obligation to protect any material that they do not wish others to \\nsee. Indeed, all users are urged to maintain protection levels on their files consistent with \\nthe access they are actually willing to give to other users. Access to Faculty Data  \\nElectronic data on a faculty member’s account, whether stored on a computer in the \\nfaculty member’s office or elsewhere under the proprietary control of that faculty \\nmember, may not be examined, i.e., the contents of the data read by a person, without \\nthe faculty member’s consent, except in cases of emergency or in response to a valid \\nsubpoena, search warrant, or order of a court. Posting of data by a faculty member on \\nservers available to the public or to students shall be understood to imply consent, and \\nelectronic access given to specific parties by the faculty member will likewise imply \\nconsent for those parties to access permitted data. Emergencies may include, for \\nexample, but are not limited to, the death, incapacity or disappearance of the faculty \\nmember, or the search for and examination of files used for apparently malicious activity \\nin an account which endangers the integrity of shared computers, the network, or other \\naspects of the university’s computing infrastructure. Only specifically designated individuals are permitted to determine what passes for an \\n“emergency.” Such individuals may be specifically designated, or may be designated by job \\n', '26 \\n \\n \\nposition/description. All assignments for individuals or positions will be done by Provost \\nor by a designate of the Provost. Whenever possible and legally permissible, notification must be given to the faculty \\nmember whose data are subject to subpoena, search warrant, or order of court prior to \\ncompliance therewith, and, whenever possible and legally permissible, sufficient time \\nmust be allowed, before intrusion, to allow the faculty member to file a motion to quash. Information obtained from an examination warranted by an emergency cannot be used \\nas evidence in university sanctions of any faculty member, and cannot be released to the \\npublic, or to the university community or to public officials, except as such releases are \\nessential to resolution of the emergency, or constitute evidence of a crime concealment of \\nwhich would obstruct justice, and in the latter case release may only be to appropriate law \\nenforcement officials. Any intrusion by an employee of the university into a faculty \\nmember’s electronic data must be reported to the faculty member as soon as possible, \\nand within five days of the event in writing both to the faculty member, if possible, and \\nunless prohibited by order of court, and to an Ombudsman, who shall be a member of \\nthe regular faculty selected annually by the Nominating Committee of the Faculty Senate \\nand who has been endorsed by majority vote of the Faculty Senate. The Ombudsman \\nshall be a current or retired regular faculty member who holds no administrative \\nappointment and is not a member of the Faculty Review Committee. The Ombudsman \\nshall have authority to investigate whether an intrusion was warranted by the policy and, \\n(i) shall inform the President and the affected faculty member of the Ombudsman’s \\nfindings; (ii) where a violation of the policy is found, shall inform the Faculty Review \\nCommittee of the policy violation; and (iii) where appropriate, in the absence of the \\naffected faculty member, to bring a grievance before the Faculty Review Committee. Violation of any aspect of this policy is a sanctionable offense. For purposes of this section, the term “faculty” shall mean any person who is a member of \\nthe Faculty Organization as defined in Article III of the Constitution of the Faculty \\nOrganization. Access to Staff Data         \\nElectronic data on a staff member’s account, whether stored on a computer in the staff \\nmember’s office or elsewhere under the proprietary control of that staff member, may \\nnot be examined, i.e., the contents of the data read by a person, without the staff \\nmember’s consent, except in cases of emergency, in response to a valid subpoena, search \\nwarrant, order of a court, or by specific request by the staff members’ supervisor for the \\npurpose of accessing work-related electronic data. Posting of data by a staff member on \\nservers available to the public or to members of the university shall be understood to \\n', '27 \\n \\n \\nimply consent, and electronic access given to specific parties by the staff member will \\nlikewise imply consent for those parties to access permitted data. Emergencies may \\ninclude, for example, but are not limited to, the death, incapacity or disappearance of the \\nstaff member, or the search for and examination of files used for apparently malicious \\nactivity in an account which endangers the integrity of shared computers, the network, or \\nother aspects of the university’s computing infrastructure. Only specifically designated individuals are permitted to determine what passes for an \\n“emergency.”  Such individuals may be specifically designated, or may be designated by \\njob position/description. All assignments for individuals or positions will be done by \\nProvost or by a designate of the Provost. Whenever possible and legally permissible, notification must be given to the staff member \\nwhose data are subject to subpoena, search warrant, or order of court prior to \\ncompliance therewith. Information obtained from an examination warranted by an \\nemergency will not be released to the public, or to the university community or to public \\nofficials, except as such releases are essential to resolution of the emergency, or \\nconstitute evidence of a crime concealment of which would obstruct justice, and in the \\nlatter case release may only be to appropriate law enforcement officials. Any such \\nfindings may be reported to the staff member’s supervisor, department head, or to \\nHuman Resources for appropriate investigation and action. Any intrusion by an employee \\nof the university into a staff member’s electronic data must be reported to the staff \\nmember as soon as possible, and within five days of the event via electronic mail unless \\nprohibited by order of court, or due to a continuance of an ongoing investigation by the \\nUniversity. Violation of any aspect of this policy is a sanctionable offense. When possible, staff members will be informed about the issuance of court orders, or \\nother intrusions into their electronic data. In cases where a staff member believes that \\nelectronic data in their account has been inappropriately accessed by another staff \\nmember, the incident should be reported to Human Resources. Access to Student Data \\nElectronic data stored in a student account, whether stored on a computer in the \\nstudent’s residence or elsewhere under the proprietary control of that student, may not \\nbe examined, i.e., the contents of the data read by a person, without the student’s \\nconsent, except in cases of emergency or in response to a valid subpoena, search warrant, \\norder of a court, or by order of the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs. Posting of data \\nby a student on servers available to the public shall be understood to imply consent, and \\nelectronic access given to specific parties by the student will likewise imply consent for \\n', '28 \\n \\n \\nthose parties to access permitted data. Emergencies may include, for example, but are \\nnot limited to, the death, incapacity or disappearance of the student, or the search for and \\nexamination of files used for apparently malicious activity in an account which endangers \\nthe integrity of shared computers, the network, or other aspects of the university’s \\ncomputing infrastructure. Only specifically designated individuals are permitted to determine what passes for an \\n“emergency”. Such individuals may be specifically designated, or may be designated by job \\nposition/description. All assignments for individuals or positions will be done by Provost \\nor by a designate of the Provost. Whenever possible and legally permissible, notification must be given to the student \\nwhose data are subject to subpoena, search warrant, or order of court prior to \\ncompliance therewith. Information obtained from an examination warranted by an \\nemergency will not be released to the public, or to the university community or to public \\nofficials, except as such releases are essential to resolution of the emergency, or \\nconstitute evidence of a crime of concealment which would obstruct justice, and in the \\nlatter case release may only be to appropriate law enforcement officials. Any findings of \\npotential wrongdoing unrelated to the original intent of the search, must be reported to \\nthe Office of the Dean of Student Affairs for appropriate investigation and action. Any \\nintrusion by an employee of the University into a student’s electronic data must be \\nreported to the student as soon as possible, and within five days of the event via \\nelectronic mail to the student, if possible, unless prohibited by an order of the court or \\nbecause of an ongoing investigation conducted by the University. Violation of any aspect \\nof this policy is a sanctionable offense. When possible, students will be informed about the issuance of court orders, or other \\nintrusions into their electronic data, including the purpose of the search. In cases where a \\nstudent believes that electronic data in their account has been inappropriately accessed \\nby a staff member, the incident should be reported to Office of the Dean of Student \\nAffairs. Note: Removable media such as floppy disks, zip drives, tapes, or CDs in a faculty or staff \\noffice, or in a residence hall are not subject to search by Computing Services, though \\nComputing Services will assist authorized law enforcement agencies or authorities to read \\ndata after they are obtained, at the agencies’ or authorities’ request. ', '29 \\n \\n \\nProtecting Confidential Information \\nUsers who maintain confidential information, such as records relating to employees or \\nstudents, are responsible for following privacy-related policies, laws, and data use \\nagreements. Protecting Personal Information  \\nAs is described throughout this policy, data transmitted across the university network or \\nstored on university systems may be accessed by others as a result of misuse by an \\nindividual, as an incidental result of the routine operation of the network and systems, or \\nin response to a court subpoena or university investigation into suspected or alleged \\nmisuse. While complete privacy of personal data may not be possible, users who wish to \\nensure a higher degree of privacy for their data are encouraged to use encryption, PGP \\nsecurity, or other techniques to reduce the risk that others may access their data. Misuse and Inappropriate Behavior \\nThe following activities are expressly prohibited at Carnegie Mellon: \\n• Using a computer system without proper authorization granted through the university, \\ncollege, or department management structure. Some activities such as “port scanning” \\nare not expressly prohibited. However, if the target of such scanning requests that an \\nindividual or system stop performing such actions, the person or system performing \\nthe scans must stop scanning the target machine unless the scans are being carried \\nout by a system administrator who has the authority and responsibility over the \\nmachine(s) being scanned or for the network being used. • Concealing your identity, or assuming the identity of another (e.g., by sending forged \\nelectronic mail). Note that some forms of electronic communication, such as browsing \\nWeb pages, passively “identify” users. Keeping your identity private either by not \\nsetting an identity in your browser or by using a Web-anonymizer in order to protect \\nyourself from being put onto mailing lists is not a violation of this policy. • Sharing your password or account with the specific exception of staff or faculty \\nmembers allowing their administrative support personnel to access their accounts in \\norder to provide services appropriate to their job functions. Note that some policies \\nfor the accessing of specific systems or data (see PCI-DSS Guidelines) explicitly forbid \\nthe sharing of passwords used to access them, and that such restrictions for those \\nspecific systems override this policy. ', '30 \\n \\n \\n• Using another person’s computer account, userID, files, or data without appropriate \\npermission, as described in the previous bullet (e.g. using an account found “logged in” \\non a cluster machine). • Deleting or tampering with another user’s files or with information stored by another \\nuser on any information-bearing medium (disk, tape, memory, etc.). Even if the user’s \\nfiles are unprotected, with the exception of files obviously intended for public reading, \\nsuch as Web pages, it is improper for another user to read them unless the owner has \\ngiven permission (e.g. in an announcement in class or on a computer bulletin board). • Attempting to “crack” or guess other users’ passwords. System administrators or those \\nspecifically designated by the administrator or owner of a system may attempt to crack \\npasswords in order to test and enhance the security of the system. In cases where an \\nindividual or department “owns” machines which use password files controlled by \\nanother organization (e.g. Andrew machines or their like), the owner may not attempt \\nto crack passwords without explicit permission by the owners of the password \\ndatabase. • Obtaining passwords by other means, such as password capturing and key logging \\nprograms. • Attempting to circumvent system security (e.g. breaking into a system or using \\nprograms to obtain “root” access), without the explicit permission of the owner of that \\nsystem. • Denying appropriate access to resources to other users (e.g. “ping flooding” another \\nsystem, sending “mail bombs,” or modifying a login file in order to cause a user to not \\nbe able to log in). • Releasing programs such as viruses, Trojan horses, worms, etc., that disrupt other \\nusers, damage software or hardware, disrupt network performance, or replicate \\nthemselves for malicious purpose. • Sending commercial solicitations via electronic mail (i.e. spamming) to individuals, or to \\nnewsgroups or mailing lists where such advertising is not part of the purpose of the \\ngroup or list. (It is permissible to send a commercial solicitation to a “for sale” \\nnewsgroup, provided that the advertisement conforms to other policies and guidelines \\nat Carnegie Mellon.) \\n• Any “mass mailing” which is solicitous in nature, unless the mailing is in the conduct of \\nuniversity business. ', \"31 \\n \\n \\n• Reselling of services based on the university network, such as web hosting, mailing \\nservices or the selling of shell accounts. • Running a proxy server which results in inappropriate or unauthorized access to \\nuniversity materials to non-university members. • Advertising commercial businesses or ventures on Web pages hosted by Carnegie \\nMellon, unless prior authorization has been granted. • Using mail messages to harass or intimidate another person (such as by repeatedly \\nsending unwanted mail or broadcasting unsolicited mail). • Violations of any local, state or federal laws, such as the distribution of copyright-\\nprotected materials (e.g. the distribution of commercial software, music or films in \\nelectronic format without appropriate permissions by the owner, even if the user \\ndistributing the materials notifies others of their copyright status). • Tampering with, willful destruction of or theft of any computer equipment, whether it \\nbelongs to the university or to an individual. Tampering includes any deliberate effort \\nto degrade or halt a system, to tie up a system or to compromise the system/network \\nperformance. Willful destruction includes any deliberate disabling or damaging of \\ncomputer systems, peripheral equipment such as scanners or printers, or other \\nfacilities or equipment including the network, and any deliberate destruction or \\nimpairment of software or other users’ files or data. • The unauthorized removal of university or another's computing equipment, which \\nconstitutes theft. This list should not be considered to be complete or exhaustive. It should, however, serve \\nas a set of examples of obviously inappropriate behaviors. If you are in doubt about the \\nappropriateness of something that you want to do, contact the Computing Services Help \\nCenter at 412-268-HELP, or send mail to it-help@andrew.cmu.edu and ask first. Enforcement \\nInappropriate behavior in the use of computers is punishable under the general university \\npolicies and regulations regarding faculty, students and staff. The offenses mentioned in \\nthis policy range from relatively minor to extremely serious, though even a minor offense \\nmay be treated severely if it is repeated or malicious. Certain offenses may also be subject \\nto prosecution under federal, state or local laws. Appropriate disciplinary action depends not only on the nature of the offense, but also on \\nthe intent and previous history of the offender. The range of possible penalties includes \\n\", '32 \\n \\n \\nreprimands, loss of computing privileges, course failures for students, disciplinary \\nprobation, suspension or dismissal from the university and/or criminal prosecution. Offenses that are minor or appear to be accidental in nature are often handled in a very \\ninformal manner such as through electronic mail. More serious offenses involve formal \\nprocedures pursued through the Division of Student Affairs for students, Human \\nResources and/or the hiring university department or administrative unit for staff, or the \\nFaculty Review Committee for faculty. Restrictions of Privileges During Investigations \\nDuring the course of an investigation of alleged inappropriate or unauthorized use, it may \\nbe necessary to temporarily suspend a user’s network or computing privileges, but only \\nafter determining there is at least a prima facie case against the individual, as well as a \\nrisk to the university or its computing resources if privileges are not revoked. In these \\ncases, it is important to recognize that the restriction of network or computing privileges \\nis intended to protect the system rather than to punish the individual. For example, if a \\ncomputer account has been used to launch an attack on another system, that account will \\nbe rendered inactive until the investigation is complete. This is a necessary action taken to \\nprevent further misuse and does not presume that the account holder initiated the \\nmisuse. Unsubstantiated reports of abuse will not result in the suspension of accounts or \\nnetwork access unless sufficient evidence is provided to show that inappropriate activity \\noccurred. For example, if someone reports that their computer was “attacked” by a \\nCarnegie Mellon system, the burden will be upon the complainant to provide sufficient \\ndata logs or other evidence to show that the incident did, indeed at least appear to be an \\nattack. Adverse Impact on Shared Systems                            \\nThe university reserves the right to discontinue communication with external systems that \\nare known to harbor spammers, account crackers, or phishing sites, despite the fact that \\nthis may restrict certain acceptable communications. When deemed necessary, this action \\nwill be taken to protect the security and safety of our systems. Similarly, there may be \\ncases where a particular service or activity on a given university system will, by the very \\nnature of its legitimate operation, tend to generate attacks from other Internet sites. If \\nthese attacks are frequent and severe enough to cause service interruptions for larger \\nparts of the campus community, it may be necessary to temporarily or permanently \\nremove these systems from the campus network. In cases where such an action is \\ndeemed necessary, network administrators will work with the maintainers of the system \\nto identify alternative methods of network access. In cases where the university restricts \\n', \"33 \\n \\n \\naccess to external sites or removes network access for internal sites, the purpose of the \\naction is to maintain the security and reliability of the computer systems and networks \\nrather than to punish an individual or a site, or to restrict the free expression of ideas. Conduct of Classes (Undergraduate Students) \\nStudents are expected to attend all scheduled classes unless the instructor explicitly informs \\nthe class that other ways of doing the work are acceptable. The action to be taken in regard \\nto tardiness, absence from class or making up late work is the responsibility of the individual \\ninstructor; the instructor should consult with the department head and the student's dean if \\nmajor action, such as dropping the student from the course, is being considered. All classes will be held at their scheduled hour on days immediately before and after all \\nholidays and recesses. Both faculty and students are expected to be present. Members of athletic teams and other student organizations are permitted to be absent from \\nclasses to participate in authorized contests and presentations, either at home or out of \\ntown, provided the following conditions are met: \\n• All work missed must be made up to the satisfaction of the instructor(s) concerned; \\n• No trip shall involve an absence of more than two days, excluding days when classes are \\nnot scheduled; \\n• The total number of days of absence shall not exceed six per sport or per organization \\nannually; \\n• Instructor(s) may request confirmation from the relevant coach, department or student \\naffairs staff member. Technology affords many students access to portable devices including cell phones, PDAs, \\nand laptops. It is expected that students will respect the wishes of faculty with regard to the \\nuse of electronic devices within the academic environment. Students who, because of religious beliefs, cannot attend class may arrange as individuals to \\nbe absent, provided the work missed is made up in a manner satisfactory to the instructor(s) \\nof the class(es) missed. No student shall leave a scheduled exercise because of the absence of the instructor until a \\nreasonable time has passed. By tradition and as a matter of courtesy a student should wait \\n10 minutes before leaving. \", \"34 \\n \\n \\nCross-College and University Registration PCHE (Pittsburgh Council on \\nHigher Education) Guidelines Policy \\nStatement \\nCross-registration provides opportunities for enriched educational programs by \\npermitting full-time paying undergraduate and graduate students to cross-register for one \\ncourse at a Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) Institution. Full-time Carnegie \\nMellon degree students are eligible. The PCHE course may not count towards full-time \\nstatus unless the student is enrolled in an inter-university program. There is no additional \\ntuition charge, except for special course or laboratory fees. Carnegie Mellon students do \\nnot acquire status at the host institution, but are given library and bookstore privileges. Credit and grades are transferred directly to the home institution. Cross-registration is not \\napplicable during the Summer Session(s) or during intersessions. There are nine approved PCHE Institutions in the Pittsburgh area: \\nCarlow University (412-578-6084), Chatham College (412-365-1121), CCAC (412-237-2555), \\nDuquesne University (412-396-6230), LaRoche College (412-367-9300), Pittsburgh \\nTheological Seminary (412-362-5610), Point Park University (412-392-3861), Robert Morris \\nCollege (412-262-8256), University of Pittsburgh (412-624-1544) \\n1. Each college or university accepts registration from the other institutions; however, \\nfirst priority is given to students of the host institution, and not all departments or \\nschools in all institutions are able to participate in this program. 2. In each case of a student cross-registration, the approval of the dean or a designated \\nindividual from the home college or university must be obtained prior to registration. 3. In addition, the student's advisor or dean is responsible for assuring the student's \\neligibility for the course in which he/she intends to enroll. 4. Full credit and grades for cross-registered courses will be transferred to the \\nappropriate institution; the academic regulations of the host university will prevail. 5. The academic honesty code and other rules of conduct of the institution providing \\ninstruction apply with respect to its courses and behavior on its campus. That \\ninstitution also determines whether its rules have or have not been violated. The \\nstudent's own institution will impose such penalties as it considers proper when \\nviolations are reported to it. \", '35 \\n \\n \\n6. Cross-registrants do not thereby acquire the status of students in the institutions in \\nwhich they are receiving instruction (e.g., for purposes of participation in student \\nactivities, insurance programs, etc.). They do receive library privileges at the host \\ninstitution and may purchase course texts at the host bookstore. 7. Each qualified student normally may enroll in no more than one course off campus in \\nany one term or semester under this program. Students wishing to cross-register for \\nmore than one course in a term must have approval from the appropriate academic \\noffices at both schools. 8. No additional tuition charge is made to students who are participating in this \\nprogram; however, the student who cross-registers is responsible for paying any \\ncourse or laboratory fees to the host. 9. Cross-registration does not apply to summer sessions at any of the institutions. 10. Adding or dropping a course after the home institution\\'s deadline date requires \\npermission from the home institution; adding or dropping a course after the host \\ninstitution\\'s deadline date requires permission from the host institution. 11. Students enrolled in approved joint co-op programs between two PCHE institutions \\nare exempt from the requirement of being full-time at either school in order to cross \\nregister. Students are bound by the requirements of that program. 12. Carnegie Mellon students may not cross-register for required courses that are \\nnormally available at Carnegie Mellon. Exceptions may be made if courses are \\nunavailable or legitimate schedule conflicts seriously hinder completion of degree \\nrequirements within the prescribed timeframe. 13. \"PCHE Cross-Registration Request\" forms are available from The HUB. Doctoral Student Status Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nThe university has a policy that covers: time limits on doctoral student status, a definition \\nof All But Dissertation status, a definition of In Residence and In Absentia status for doctoral \\nstudents and the tuition and fees charged for students In Residence and students In \\nAbsentia. ', \"36 \\n \\n \\nThese rules apply to all doctoral students. Students who began their doctoral studies prior \\nto the date of this policy’s revision may follow time-to-degree requirements from the \\nprevious policy, but all other rules set forth in this policy will apply immediately to all \\ndoctoral students. Time to Degree \\nStudents will complete all requirements for the Ph.D. degree within a maximum of ten \\nyears from original matriculation as a doctoral student, or less if required by a more \\nrestrictive department or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the \\nperson may resume work towards a doctoral degree only if newly admitted to a currently \\noffered doctoral degree program under criteria determined by that program. Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, \\nfamily or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the \\nrelevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean, defer \\nthe lapse of All But Dissertation status for a period commensurate with the duration of \\nthat interruption. Students, who are pursuing the Ph.D. degree as part-time students for \\nall semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their \\nprogram or department for extension of the time to degree limit. All But Dissertation Status \\nAll But Dissertation, ABD, status is intended for students whose only remaining \\nrequirements are the completion and defense of their dissertation. Once a student meets \\nthe departmental criteria [1], All But Dissertation status must be approved by the \\ndepartment by submitting the appropriate form to CMURegistrar@andrew.cmu.edu. In Residence Versus In Absentia \\nOnce students achieve All But Dissertation status, they must choose whether to complete \\ntheir dissertation In Residence or In Absentia. A doctoral student In Residence maintains \\nstudent status and all consequent student privileges and continues to be actively engaged \\nwith the university. A doctoral student In Absentia status is one who has left the university \\nwith the intent of completing their dissertation but is not actively engaged with the \\nuniversity and does not require university resources. When a student decides whether to \\npursue All But Dissertation In Residence or In Absentia, they must complete a Doctoral \\nStudent Status Agreement form, which is available through their academic department or \\non the HUB website. Once the agreement has been approved by the student’s \\n \\n1 General examples of having met All But Dissertation requirements may include completing all courses and passing qualifying \\nexams; completing all courses and acceptance of dissertation proposal; etc. as defined by program, department or school.\", '', '37 \\n \\n \\ndepartment, the student may change their status between In Residence and In Absentia \\nmultiple times with approval. A student In Residence or In Absentia must meet the specific \\ncriteria noted later in this policy. Students In Absentia will not be verified by the university as an enrolled \"student\" for \\nimmigration or loan purposes. All But Dissertation students in J1 or F1 immigration status \\nmust continue to follow the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulations [2]. All But Dissertation Students In Residence \\nAll But Dissertation students In Residence receiving any financial support (such as tuition, \\nstipend, fees or health insurance, whether full or partial), tied to activities that are integral \\nto their doctoral program that is  paid by or administered by the university must be \\nenrolled for at least thirty-six units to maintain full time student status and all subsequent \\nstudent privileges. Exceptions to the thirty-six unit enrollment requirement may be \\ngranted by the Provost [3]. All But Dissertation students In Residence who are not receiving any financial support \\n(such as tuition, stipend, fees or health insurance, whether full or partial), from the \\nuniversity tied to activities that are integral to their doctoral program should consult their \\ncollege policy to determine the number of units for which they must be registered in \\norder to maintain full-time student status and all subsequent privileges. All But Dissertation students In Residence who are pursuing their doctoral degree on a part \\ntime basis and are not receiving any financial support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or \\nhealth insurance, whether full or partial), from the university tied to activities that are \\nintegral to their doctoral program should consult their college policy to determine the \\nnumber of units they must be registered for in order to maintain part time student status \\nand all subsequent privileges. Note that doctoral students must be a full time graduate \\nstudent for at least one academic year or more if required by the student’s home college. All But Dissertation students who are employed by the university in a capacity \\nindependent of their educational program and are pursuing a doctoral degree part time, \\nmay register for the number of units required by their department in order to remain in \\npart time status so long as they are not receiving any financial support (such as tuition, \\nstipend, fees or health insurance, whether full or partial), tied to activities that are integral \\n \\n2 The intent of the DHS regulations is that the student continues to pursue completion of the degree on a full-time basis under \\nthe jurisdiction of the university that will award the degree. International students who enter All But Dissertation status must \\nremain In Residence and be registered full-time as defined in this policy to preserve F1 or J1 immigration status while they \\ncomplete their degree.

Final Semester Tuition for All But Dissertation Students In Residence \\nStudents who are supported by the university must be registered for thirty-six units for \\nthe entirety of their final semester and will be assessed their college’s full-time tuition. FULL-TIME STUDENTS \\nIf a student completes all Ph.D. degree requirements and is certified by: \\n• September 30th (in the fall), or February 28th (in the spring), tuition will be adjusted \\nto $0; however, they will remain enrolled for thirty-six units for the semester. • October 31st (in the fall), or March 31st (in the spring), tuition will be adjusted to 50% \\nof the full-time tuition; however, they will remain enrolled for thirty-six units for the \\nsemester. • After October 31st (in the fall), or after March 31st (in the spring), but BEFORE the \\nfirst day of the next semester, tuition will not be adjusted and they will remain \\nenrolled for thirty-six units for the semester. • Fees will not be adjusted after the semester course add deadline. • Tuition will not be assessed in the summer, except for students who return from All \\nBut Dissertation In Absentia status and who are registered for thirty-six units. For \\nthose students who are certified by June 15th tuition will be adjusted to $0; for those \\nwho are certified by July 15th tuition will be adjusted to 50% of the full-time tuition. For those who are certified after July 15th but BEFORE the first day of the next \\nsemester, tuition will not be adjusted, and they will remain enrolled for thirty-six \\nunits for the semester. PART-TIME STUDENTS \\nStudents registered for fewer than thirty-six units are not eligible for a tuition \\nadjustment, regardless of their certification date. Fees will not be adjusted. All But Dissertation Students In Absentia \\nAn All But Dissertation doctoral student may, upon departmental approval, be regarded \\nas In Absentia when, and so long as, the following three conditions apply: \\n• The student has been enrolled as a full-time graduate student at Carnegie Mellon \\nUniversity for at least one academic year or more if required by the student's home \\n\", \"39 \\n \\n \\ncollege. Part-time graduate enrollment may, at the department's discretion, be \\ncounted pro-rata toward this requirement. • The student does not receive any financial support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or \\nhealth insurance) tied to activities that are integral to their doctoral program that is \\npaid by or administered by the university. • The student does not require substantial use of university resources. Departmental \\napproval of this condition shall be subject to guidelines established by the school or \\ncollege. According to university guidelines, students In Absentia may [4]: \\n• Use University Libraries. • Use the university stores. • Use computing facilities only for department communications and for dissertation text \\npreparation. • Enter university buildings for faculty/student consultations. • Be eligible for student health insurance as determined on a case by case basis [5]. • Use the Career and Professional Development Center. • Become university employees. May not: \\n• Be employed with a graduate student stipend [6]. • Maintain legal F1 or J1 student status. • Use University Health Services [5]. • Buy parking permits [7]. • Use athletic facilities [7]. 4 An All But Dissertation student In Absentia may be hired as an university employee without switching to active student status \\nso long as the hiring department certifies that the student is not hired at Carnegie Mellon for work directly related to his/her \\ndissertation and that the student does not inappropriately make substantial use of resources for work towards the doctorate as \\nnoted above. As an employee, an individual would be eligible for benefits that apply to his/her status as an employee, not as a \\ngraduate student. 5 University Health Services is not available to students in In Absentia status, except in an emergency, or on a case by case basis. All inquiries may be directed to the Manager of Business Operations, University Health Services. 6 Graduate students are not considered employees of the university as their primary affiliation with the university is as a student. 7 An individual whose primary relationship with the university is as an employee and who as Ph.D. student moves to the status of \\nABD In Absentia will be eligible for benefits that apply to his/her status as an employee. \", \"40 \\n \\n \\n• Reside in university housing. Employment of All But Dissertation Students In Absentia \\nAs noted above, All But Dissertation students In Absentia are extended only minimum \\naccess to university resources. The student does not receive any financial support (such as \\ntuition, stipend, fees, or health insurance, whether full or partial), tied to activities that are \\nintegral to their doctoral program paid by or administered by the university. An All But \\nDissertation student In Absentia cannot be hired for work by Carnegie Mellon University \\ndirectly related to completing their dissertation and/or make substantial use of resources \\nfor work toward the doctorate as noted above [4]. In order to be in compliance with these \\npolicies, the university's employment policies and the Internal Revenue Service, an All But \\nDissertation student In Absentia may only be hired for university employment through the \\nappropriate employment process. Questions should be referred to Human Resources. Tuition and Fee Effects of In Absentia Student Status Including the Final Semester \\nWhile an All But Dissertation student is In Absentia, no tuition will be assessed. The student \\nwill, however, be responsible for all applicable fees. An All But Dissertation student who is In Absentia, who returns to defend their dissertation \\nhas several options: \\n1. A student who receives support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or health insurance, \\nwhether full or partial) paid for or administered by the university, must follow the \\npolicy for Final Semester Tuition for All But Dissertation Students In Residence (see \\nabove) and is eligible for the tuition to be pro-rated as identified in the schedule. 2. A student who is not receiving any financial support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or \\nhealth insurance, whether full or partial), paid for or administered by the university \\nand is returning to the university must change from In Absentia to In Residence and \\nshall be assessed for a minimum of five units of graduate study based on their \\ncurrent school/college’s tuition before the degree is certified. The tuition rate will not \\nbe adjusted based on certification date.\", 'a. A student returns to the university solely for the purpose of the defense and is In \\nResidence for 10 or fewer days would pay the technology fee in addition to the \\ntuition. b. A student returns to the university solely for the purpose of the defense and is In \\nResidence for more than 10 days would pay the technology, transportation, and \\nstudent activities fee in addition to the tuition.

Such a student will be not be charged \\ntuition but would be charged a Dissertation Completion Fee and technology fee. Evaluation and Certification of English Fluency for Instructors Policy \\nSummary of How the Carnegie Mellon Policy Satisfies the Pennsylvania English \\nFluency in Higher Education Act \\n• The Pennsylvania English Fluency in Higher Education Act requires the University to file \\nannually with the Pennsylvania Department of Education a certification stating that its \\ninstructional personnel are fluent in the English language. All instructional personnel, \\nboth native and nonnative speakers of English who teach undergraduate students, \\nmust be included in CMU's annual certification process. • Faculty members who are native speakers of English and who teach undergraduates \\nwill be certified by their departments on the basis of conversations with the dean, \\ndepartment head or specified designee. Departments cannot assume that someone is \\na native speaker without talking with him or her. • The fluency of non-native English speaking faculty members will be evaluated through \\ntwo interviews: one with the dean, department head or specified designee, and the \\nsecond with a senior faculty member. All interviewers must be native speakers of \\nEnglish. • TA English fluency — both graduate and undergraduate — is managed through the \\nInternational Teaching Assistant testing process administered by CMU's Intercultural \\nCommunication Center. (Note: CMU policy requires the International Teaching Assistant Test for TAs of both \\ngraduate as well as undergraduate classes.) \\n• Consistent with Pennsylvania law, CMU allows for the following exemptions from \\ncertification: 1) visiting faculty, 2) faculty who will teach courses taught predominantly \\nin a foreign language, 3) faculty who do not teach undergraduate students, and 4) \\nfaculty who work one-on-one with students. (Note: CMU requires TAs to take the ITA for any job that requires student interaction.) \\n\", \"42 \\n \\n \\nExaminations for Undergraduate Courses Policy \\nPreamble \\nThe Faculty Senate adopted the following policies on the administration of examinations \\nfor the undergraduate courses (defined as courses that are numbered 6xx or below). These policies represent an understanding between faculty and student concerning an \\nimportant but often stressful period, especially at the conclusion of each academic \\nsemester and at mid-semester. There should be no expectation that the following points \\nwill cover every conceivable situation. The student should anticipate the demands of the \\nexam schedule, plan accordingly and early, and be prepared. The faculty should recognize \\nthat the student is encumbered with many tightly orchestrated and intensive obligations \\nduring this period over which he or she has no control: expectations should be reasonably \\nconsistent with the number of course units and, of course, should be made known to the \\nstudent well in advance of the final examination period, preferably as part of the course \\nsyllabus. In order to help students plan their time and study optimally for examinations, this \\ndocument lays out in some detail the policies regarding final and in-term examinations. Instructors are requested to provide notification of the major in-term examinations in the \\ncourse syllabus. The final examination date is posted early in the semester. It is the \\nresponsibility of the student to give his or her instructor sufficient notice and to work with \\nthe instructor to re-schedule examinations if this is needed. Definitions \\n• Final examination period. The university's official final examination period begins on \\nthe Monday immediately following the last day of classes and continues through the \\nlast day of scheduled final examinations, with the exception of reading day(s). • Scheduled final examinations. Scheduled final examinations are those scheduled by \\nthe University Registrar's Office. • Self-scheduled examinations. An instructor may choose not to fix a schedule for the \\nfinal examination, but instead allow each student to choose the examination time; \\nsuch exams are called self-scheduled examinations. • Final examinations. Final examinations can either be comprehensive, covering all \\ncourse materials, or non-comprehensive, covering only a part of the course. • In-term examinations. Major examinations during the semester are referred to here as \\nin-term examinations. \", \"43 \\n \\n \\nPolicies \\nI. In-term Examinations \\n1. All in-term examinations should be given during the regularly scheduled class time. However, if the exam requires additional time to complete, then examinations may \\nbe administered outside of regularly scheduled class time. 2. No examinations given outside of class time (excluding make ups and self-scheduled \\nexaminations) shall be administered on a Friday after 4:30 pm, or at any time \\nSaturday or Sunday. 3. The instructor administering an exam (or another required class event) that falls \\noutside class time must make any and all reasonable accommodations to provide an \\nalternative time to students who have conflicts with the proposed time period, \\nincluding those conflicts due to activities, meetings, other classes, etc. (provided that \\nthe instructor is notified of such conflict in a timely manner). 4. No student shall be required to take more than two full-period in-class or out-of-class \\nexaminations on the same day. It is the responsibility of the student to notify the \\ninstructor in a timely manner of his/her circumstance so that appropriate \\naccommodations can be made. II. Final Examinations \\n1. All scheduled final examinations are held at the end of the semester during the \\nuniversity's official final examination period. Comprehensive final examinations are \\nnot required for each course, but are given at the option of the department or \\ninstructor. The reading day and weekend preceding the examination days shall never \\nbe used for examination purposes of any kind, unless a student opts to take a self-\\nscheduled examination during this time. Non-comprehensive final examinations or \\nfinal projects (but not both) are allowed during this final examination period only in \\ncourses that do not give a final comprehensive examination. 2. Instructors are expected to return all work assigned no later than the last regular day \\nof classes in courses for which there is a final examination. In cases when this is not \\npossible, an answer key, solution sets or equivalent feedback should be provided \\nunless the final examination will not cover material in work that has not been \\nreturned. \", \"44 \\n \\n \\n3. No other coursework, including laboratory or studio work, will be due during the final \\nexamination period unless it is assigned in advance and in lieu of the course's final \\nexamination. Regardless of whether there is a final examination in the course, no \\nclasses other than review sessions shall be held during the final examination period. Review sessions should be scheduled for optimal attendance, and a serious effort \\nshould be made to accommodate students who cannot attend. In appreciation of the \\ntime required to prepare for final examinations, no other examinations, portfolio \\nreviews, critiques or juries shall be scheduled for the last class day of a course with a \\nfinal examination. 4. Instructors shall never exert or submit to pressures to move an examination so that \\npeople can leave earlier nor pressure students to take an examination on a reading \\nday or weekend preceding examinations. 5. No student is required to take more than two scheduled examinations that start \\nwithin a 25-hour period. A student who has more than two examinations scheduled \\nwithin a 25-hour period or has two examinations scheduled at the same time should \\nfirst contact the instructors of the courses for assistance in resolving conflicts. If the \\nproblem cannot be resolved by that means, the student should contact the associate \\ndean of his or her home college. 6. Take-home final examinations shall be given for any 24-hour period of the student's \\nchoosing during the final examination period. 7. Students are expected to present themselves at the place assigned at the start of the \\nexamination; late arrival will reduce the total time a student has to complete the \\nexamination, unless instructor's course policy indicates otherwise. Instructors \\nreserve the right to require attendance within a specific time period. Students who \\nmiss an examination with a reasonable excuse and wish to petition for a make-up \\nfinal examination should check with the instructor. Instructors are encouraged to \\ninclude late arrival policy and make-up exam policy in the course syllabus. 8. Any student shall be permitted to review his or her corrected, graded final \\nexamination in the presence of an instructor or a teaching assistant. Any controversy \\narising from this review shall be dealt with in accordance with the university \\nprocedure for the appeal of grades and academic actions. A final examination that is \\nnot returned to a student will be kept available for a year for review. In the event that \\nthe instructor or teaching assistant is not available for the review, the responsibility \\n\", \"45 \\n \\n \\nshall rest with the department head of the instructor offering the course or his or her \\ndesignee. Since instructors are expected to return all work assigned before the final \\nexaminations, they are not responsible for retaining unclaimed coursework. 9. Concerns related to final examination, complaints about violations of the final \\nexamination policy or alterations of the final examination schedule should be \\ndirected to the department head of the instructor offering the course or to the \\nassociate dean of the student's home college. Fair Use Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nMembers of the university community often find it necessary to make scholarly use of \\nmaterials copyrighted by third-parties. The Copyright Act contains many exceptions and \\nlimitations that permit the use of a work without the permission of the copyright owner, \\nmost notably fair use. 1. It is the policy of Carnegie Mellon University that all members of the University \\ncommunity must comply with U.S. Copyright Law, in particular the Copyright Act of \\n1976, 17 U.S.C § 1, et seq. 2. Copyrighted works may be used freely by the copyright owner. Works in the public \\ndomain (generally, material published before 1923) may be used freely by everyone. 3. Faculty, students, and staff members of Carnegie Mellon University may use \\ncopyrighted materials of other parties provided such activities are allowed by license \\nor by a specific exception in copyright law including but not limited to: \\n• 17 U.S.C. § 108 - library uses; \\n• 17 U.S.C. § 109(a) - the first sale doctrine; \\n• 17 U.S.C. § 109(a) - the right to display copies; \\n• 17 U.S.C. § 110(1) - performance and display in classrooms; \\n• 17 U.S.C. § 110(2) - distance education; and \\n• 17 U.S.C. § 121 - reproduction and distribution of copies in specialized formats for \\nthe print disabled. \", '46 \\n \\n \\n4. When a proposed use is not permitted by license and does not fall within one of the \\nspecific exceptions, it may still be permitted under the fair use doctrine, codified at \\n17 U.S.C. § 107. Appendix A to this policy contains guidance to assist university \\ncommunity members in determining whether a use qualifies as a fair use. 5. When a proposed use of copyright material does not fall within the fair use doctrine \\nand is not otherwise permitted by license or exception, written permission from the \\ncopyright owner is required to engage in use. Appendix A: Guidance on Fair Use Standards \\nBackground \\nThe ability to reuse pre-existing copyrighted materials is central to the mission of the \\nUniversity in the 21st Century. A faculty member might wish to include a quotation in a \\nbook or distribute an article to her students through a course website. A student might \\nwant to create a multimedia project incorporating images, film clips, and music samples \\nfor a class assignment. A librarian may seek to digitally preserve archival material. The \\nCopyright Act contains many exceptions and limitations that permit the use of a work \\nwithout the permission of the copyright owner, most notably fair use. Although these \\nexceptions have always been important to the academic enterprise, the digital revolution \\nenables a wide range of new uses that significantly enhance the educational and scholarly \\nprocess, thereby increasing the reliance on these exceptions generally, and fair use in \\nparticular. According to the Supreme Court, the objectives of the fair use doctrine are to preserve \\nfree speech and to promote creativity. Codified in the Copyright Act of 1976 at 17 U.S.C. § \\n107, the preamble to the fair use doctrine lists six favored purposes: criticism, comment, \\nteaching, scholarship, and research. For this reason, the Supreme Court has recognized \\nthat \"the fair use defense affords considerable latitude for scholarship and comment.\" \\nAfter the preamble, Section 107 sets forth four non-exclusive factors courts must consider \\nin determining whether a use is fair. Courts have broadened their interpretation of the \\nfour factors significantly over time. Recent interpretations have favored educational uses \\ninvolving new technologies. When conducting a fair use analysis, members of the University community should \\nconsider (1) the fair use factors and (2) applicable codes of best practices. The following \\n', '47 \\n \\n \\nguidance is designed to assist members of the University community in conducting a \\nproper fair use analysis. [8] \\n1. The Fair Use Factors \\nMembers of the University community are required by Section 107 to consider and \\nbalance the following factors to determine if a use qualifies as a fair use. The factors \\nshould not be balanced mechanically, but weighed together \"in light of the purposes of \\ncopyright.\" The ultimate test of fair use \"is whether copyright\\'s goal of promoting the \\nProgress of Science and useful Arts would be better served by allowing the use than by \\npreventing it.\" \\nA. The purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial \\nnature or is for nonprofit educational purposes. • Courts have favored nonprofit education uses, including making multiple copies for \\nclassroom use, and \"transformative\" uses where the new use does not supersede the \\noriginally intended use. • The repurposing or re-contextualization of a work can be transformative, even if the \\nwork itself is not modified. • Digitization of works to provide access to the print disabled, to enable indexing, and \\nto enable \"non-consumptive research\" (e.g. text mining) has been considered \\ntransformative. B. Nature of the copyrighted work. • Courts have favored uses of factual works, as opposed to fiction, and uses of \\npublished works as opposed to unpublished works. • If a use is transformative, the nature of the work is less important. C. Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a \\nwhole. • Minimal copying does not trigger infringement liability and thus does not require fair \\nuse analysis. • The extent of permissible copying under fair use varies with the purpose and \\ncharacter of the use. 8 This guidance contains citations to some more recent court decisions. For the sake of brevity not all legal principles in this \\nguidance contain citations. Please contact the Office of the General Counsel if you have any questions regarding this guidance. ', '48 \\n \\n \\n• Copying an entire work may be permissible if necessary to achieve a legitimate \\npurpose. For example, the copying of entire works did not weight against fair use \\nwhen necessary for the purpose of providing access to the print disabled or \\nproviding a search index to complete works. • Copying of a quantitatively small portion of a work can weigh against fair use if the \\nportion used is \"the heart\" of the work. • The inclusion of one chapter of a book in electronic course reserves did not weigh \\nagainst fair use even when the publisher made available licenses for digital excerpts. D. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. • Although in the past this factor was considered to be the most important in the fair \\nuse analysis, this no longer is true. • Courts examine whether the secondary use usurps the market for the original work. • With respect to impact on potential licensing revenue, courts look at \"traditional, \\nreasonable, or likely to be developed markets.\" \\n• Markets for transformative uses are not traditional markets; hence, a transformative \\nuse does not impair the market for purposes of this factor. • Even when a court concluded a use was non-transformative, it considered the \\nadverse impact on a licensing market only if the license was easily accessible, \\nreasonably priced, and available for the portion and format the user sought to use. E. Good Faith of User \\n• Some courts have identified a fifth, non-statutory factor: whether the user acted in \\ngood faith. • This factor should typically weigh in favor of nonprofit educational uses. • Documentation of the user\\'s fair use analysis, such as a fair use checklist or a \\nstatement of pedagogical need, demonstrates the user\\'s good faith. Although copyright law generally does not require a user to attribute the source of \\nmaterial, such attribution demonstrates the user\\'s good faith. (Attribution often also is \\nrequired as a matter of academic ethics as well as the terms of a Creative Commons \\nlicense.) \\nIn addition, courts have treated as fair use: \\n', \"49 \\n \\n \\n• Copying incidental to the streaming of films assigned for courses [9]; \\n• Inclusion of chapters of monographs (but not textbooks) in electronic course reserves [10]; \\nand \\n• Mass digitization of books for the purpose of preservation, creating a search index, and \\nproviding access to the print disabled. [11] \\nWhen considering similar uses, members of the University community should treat these \\ndecisions as important guideposts. 2. Best Practices \\nSeveral educational communities have developed codes of best practices in fair use.[12] \\nThese codes each represent a community's consensus about acceptable practices for the \\nfair use of copyrighted materials. Legal scholarship has demonstrated that courts give \\nweight to what a relevant community considers to be acceptable practice. When \\nexercising the fair use doctrine, members of the University community should consult and \\nfollow the appropriate code of best practices. In particular, the Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Academic and Research Libraries (see \\nlink below) articulates a set of principles for how fair use applies to certain common \\npractices in the university setting. The Code sets forth limitations that should be observed \\nto assure that the case for fair use is strong, and enhancements that could further \\nstrengthen that case. These principles include that it is fair use to: \\n• Make appropriately tailored course-related content available to enrolled students via \\ndigital networks; \\n• Make digital copies for purposes of preservation, and to make these copies available \\nas surrogates for fragile and inaccessible materials; \\n• Create digital versions of a library's special collections and to make these versions \\nelectronically accessible in appropriate contexts; \\n \\n9 Association for Info. Media and Equip. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 2011 WL 7447148 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 3, 2011). 10 Cambridge Univ. Press v. Becker, 769 F.3d 1262 (11th Cir. 2014). 11 Authors Guild Inc., v. Hathi Trust, 755 F.3d 87 (2nd Cir. 2014). 12 See Association of Research Libraries, Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Academic and Research Libraries (available at \\nhttp://www.arl.org/focus-areas/copyright-ip/fair-use/code-of-best-practices#.W7JRcWhKhPY); see also American University \\nCenter for Social Media, Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Open Course Ware; Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Media Literacy \\nEducation; Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Scholarly Research in Communication; and Society for Cinema and Media Studies' \\nStatement of Best Practices in Fair Use in Teaching for Film and Media Educators (available at http://www.cmsimpact.org). \", '50 \\n \\n \\n• Reproduce materials in accessible formats for disabled students when fully accessible \\ncopies are not readily available for commercial sources; \\n• Receive material for an institutional repository, and to make deposited works publicly \\navailable; \\n• Develop digital databases to enable non-consumptive analysis for scholarly and \\nreference purposes, including search; and \\n• Create collections of websites and other material from the Internet and to make them \\navailable for scholarly use. The enhancements often involve the use of technological measures to restrict access to \\nthe appropriate set of users, and to prevent unnecessarily broad dissemination. Like the \\njudicial determinations of fair use, this Code of Best Practices should inform the fair use \\ncalculus performed by members of the University community.[13] \\nAlthough the judicial decisions and the Codes of Best Practices are instructive, members of \\nthe University must consider the application of the fair use doctrine to the unique facts of \\nthe proposed used. Final Examinations for Graduate Courses \\nThere is no university policy on the administration of final examinations for the graduate \\ncourses. Students should consult their department or college handbooks for applicable \\npolicies. Concerns related to final examinations for graduate courses may be directed to the \\ncourse instructor, the department head of the instructor offering the course, or to the \\ngraduate associate dean (or equivalent) of the student’s home college. For information pertaining to final examinations for undergraduate students, please review \\nthe Examinations for Undergraduate Students Policy. Financial Aid Policy \\nStatement \\nUniversity Academic Scholarship Renewals \\nCarnegie Mellon University awards academic scholarships as part of the freshman \\nfinancial aid process. Each of these scholarships is renewable for four academic years of \\n \\n13 As noted above, other fair use Codes of Best Practices may be relevant as well. ', \"51 \\n \\n \\nstudy (five for architecture) based upon the maintenance of a specific cumulative quality \\npoint average. The academic scholarship renewal criteria are included in the scholarship \\nnotification letter which is mailed to the student prior to the May 1 matriculation deadline. Each scholarship recipient's cumulative quality point average is reviewed at the end of \\neach academic year. If the student achieves the scholarship renewal criteria, then the \\nscholarship is automatically renewed for the next academic year. If the student does not meet the cumulative quality point average requirement for \\nrenewal, then s/he is given the opportunity to appeal. A merit scholarship appeal form \\nand instructions are automatically sent to the student at the end of each academic year. The student's completed appeal form is reviewed by members of the Enrollment Services \\nstaff. Input from the Associate Dean of the student's college is also considered. The \\nstudent is notified, in writing, of the decision. The decision may be to renew the \\nscholarship for the entire academic year, renew the scholarship for one academic term, or \\nto reject the appeal. If the appeal is rejected, a written explanation is provided to the \\nstudent. Undergraduate Tuition Exchange Programs \\nCarnegie Mellon University assesses the standard tuition charge for the undergraduate \\ntuition exchange programs. Since Carnegie Mellon assesses the tuition charge, the student can be considered for all \\nforms of institutional, state, and federal aid for which the student may have eligibility with \\nthe exception of any student employment program. Undergraduate Study Abroad Programs \\nCarnegie Mellon University does not assess the tuition charge for any of the Study Abroad \\nPrograms. Since Carnegie Mellon does not assess the tuition charge, the student is not considered \\nfor any institutional grants and scholarships. However, Carnegie Mellon will consider any \\nstudent participating in an approved Study Abroad Program for all state and federal \\nstudent aid programs for which the student may have eligibility with the exception of any \\nstudent employment program. The U.S. Department of Education and Carnegie Mellon University define an approved \\nStudy Abroad Program as one which is part of a contractual agreement between Carnegie \\nMellon and the host institution. Additionally, courses taken in the Study Abroad Program \\nmust be accepted for transfer to Carnegie Mellon by the Dean of the student's college. \", '52 \\n \\n \\nUndergraduate International Students \\nFor purposes of undergraduate student financial aid, an International Student is defined \\nas someone who is neither a U.S. citizen nor an eligible noncitizen. The U.S. Department \\nof Education defines an eligible noncitizen as: \\n1. An individual who is a permanent resident of the United States (as evidenced by an I-\\n151 or I-551 card); or \\n2. An individual who can provide documentation from the U.S. Immigration and \\nNaturalization Service (INS) that s/he is in the United States for other than a temporary \\npurpose with the intention of becoming a citizen or permanent resident of the United \\nStates. An undergraduate, International Student is ineligible to receive any federal or state \\nstudent financial aid. Additionally, Carnegie Mellon does not award any institutional \\nfinancial aid funds to undergraduate International Students. Financial Obligations \\nStudents should pay the amounts due on their E-Bill by the due date on their invoice. Past \\ndue accounts are subject to a 1.5% penalty charge each month until the balance is paid in \\nfull. All financial obligations to the university need to be met or future enrollment and other \\nservices may be affected. These obligations include, but are not limited to, tuition, fees, room \\nand board, student health insurance, library or parking fines, or any other charges due to the \\nuniversity. Grading Policies \\nPolicy Statement \\nThis policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking \\ncourses, whether those students are undergraduates, non-degree students or graduate \\nstudents. This policy covers the specifics of Assigning and Changing Grades (including \\nFinal and Mid-Semester grades, Incompletes and Conditional Failures), Grading Options \\n(Audit and Pass/Fail), Drop/Withdrawals, Course Repeats, and defines the undergraduate \\nand graduate Grading Standards. ', \"53 \\n \\n \\nQuestions about grading for a specific course should be addressed to the instructor of the \\ncourse in question. Graduate students with questions about Pass/Fail and \\nDrop/Withdrawal should contact their individual programs. Appeals for an exception to any grading policy may be made by the dean's office of the \\nstudent’s home college. 1. Definitions \\nCertain terms are used in this document with specific meanings, as defined in this section. • Student means any full-time or part-time degree-seeking undergraduate or graduate \\nstudent, or full-time or part-time non-degree student. • Non-degree student means a student that is not in a university degree program. • Faculty means members of the university's Faculty Organization as defined in the \\nFaculty Handbook, plus instructors and special faculty appointments (even in the first \\nyear), and part-time faculty. • Instructor means a faculty member, teaching assistant, and /or lecturer who is the \\ninstructor of record, as recorded in the Student Information System (SIS). 2. Policy Provisions \\nAssigning Grades \\nFinal grades are awarded to each student, in each course scheduled, at the end of the \\nsemester, mini-semester or summer session. All students taking a course at Carnegie \\nMellon must be assigned grades. Enrollment Services will query instructors who do not assign a grade to a student. Copies \\nof the query regarding the lack of grade will be sent to the student, to the dean and to the \\ndepartment head. If the instructor does not assign a letter grade or an incomplete grade \\nwithin one month of Enrollment Service’s query, the department head will be responsible \\nfor insuring that a grade is assigned. Changing a Grade \\nA student who believes that an assigned grade is incorrect, may request that a final grade \\nbe changed. Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with \\nthe approval of the instructor and, for undergraduates, with the approval of the dean’s \\noffice of the college/school offering the course; for graduate students, department \\napproval is required. The intention of this policy is to insure that, under normal \\n\", \"54 \\n \\n \\ncircumstances, all students in a class are treated equally and no student is unduly \\nadvantaged. Mid-Semester Grades \\nMid-semester grades provide valuable feedback to students as they assess their \\nperformance in courses. Furthermore, mid-semester grades and the QPA's they generate \\nare used by Deans and advisors in identifying and dealing in a timely way with students in \\nacademic trouble. Therefore it is imperative that mid-semester grades accurately reflect \\nstudent performance and are turned in on time. Mid-semester grades are not permanent and are kept only until final grades are recorded. Because mid-semester grades are not permanent, changes of mid-semester grades as a \\nrule will not be accepted. Incomplete Grades \\nCarnegie Mellon students are expected to complete a course during the academic \\nsemester in which the course was taken. However, if the instructor agrees, a grade of I \\n(incomplete) may be given when a student, for reasons beyond his or her control, has \\nbeen unable to complete the work of a course, but the work completed to date is of \\npassing quality and the grade of incomplete provides no undue advantage to that student \\nover other students. In awarding an I grade, an instructor must specify the requirements for completing the \\nwork and designate a default letter grade where no further work is submitted. Students \\nmust complete the required course work no later than the end of the following academic \\nsemester, or sooner if required by prior agreement. The instructor must record the \\npermanent grade by the last day of the examination period of that following semester, or \\nEnrollment Services will administratively assign the default grade. Pass/Fail Grades \\nUndergraduate students may elect to take a free-elective course pass/fail unless \\nprecluded by the course, the course's department or the student's home \\ndepartment/college. Policies for graduate students vary and students should be advised \\nto check with their individual colleges/departments/programs for details. A student must \\nsubmit a Grade Option Request Form to Enrollment Services indicating the course they \\nare electing as pass/fail before the end of the university's withdraw period. This decision is \\nirreversible thereafter. No information regarding the student's decision will be passed on \\nto the instructor. Instructors will submit letter grades, which will automatically be \\nconverted to pass/fail. \", \"55 \\n \\n \\nA through D work will receive credit for units passed and be recorded as P on the \\nstudent's academic record; below D work will receive no credit and will be recorded as N \\non the student's academic record. No quality points will be assigned to P or N units; P or N \\nunits will not be factored into the student's QPA. In exceptional circumstances, departments may ask to designate a course pass/fail or \\nrequest that the course be evaluated only with letter grades. The College Council must \\napprove designating a course as pass/fail only or as graded only. If such a decision will \\nhave an adverse effect on the requirements of any other college, Academic Council must \\nreview the decision. The decision to designate a course as graded or pass/fail must be \\nmade before the add period for the course and is irreversible thereafter. Audit Grades \\nAuditing is presence in the classroom without receiving academic credit, a pass/fail or a \\nletter grade. The extent of a student’s participation must be arranged and approved by \\nthe course instructor. A student wishing to audit a course is required to register for the \\ncourse, complete the Course Audit Approval Form, obtain permission of the course \\ninstructor and their advisor, and return the form to The HUB prior to the last day to add a \\ncourse. Any student enrolled full-time (36 units) may audit a course without additional charges. Part-time or non-degree students who choose to audit a course will be assessed tuition at \\nthe regular per-unit tuition rate. Drop/Withdrawal Grades \\nStudents at Carnegie Mellon may drop a course by accessing on-line registration on or \\nbefore the drop deadline as published in the official university calendar. This applies to all \\ncourses with the exception of mini-semester courses. Policies for graduate students vary \\nand students should be advised to check with their individual \\ncolleges/departments/programs for details. The deadline to drop a mini-semester course \\nis the last day of the second week of the mini-semester course. When a course is dropped \\nby these deadlines, the course is removed and does not appear on the academic record. After the deadline to drop, students may withdraw from a course by accessing on-line \\nregistration by the end of the 10th week of class as noted in the academic calendar. After \\nthe deadline to drop, a W (withdrawal) grade is assigned and appears on the student's \\nacademic record. W grades do not apply to graduate students except in Tepper and MCS. Students may use a late drop voucher for a limited number of course drops after the \\ndeadline during the pursuit of their degree. This action must be taken through \\nconsultation with their academic advisor or associate dean. Details on the late drop \\n\", \"56 \\n \\n \\nvoucher process can be found in the Undergraduate Catalog and the Graduate Education \\nwebsite. Undergraduates who are registered as full-time students as of the 10th day of classes are \\nexpected to remain full-time for the duration of the semester. Full-time is defined as \\nregistered for a minimum of 36 units. Permission to drop below the 36-unit minimum can \\nonly be granted in extraordinary circumstances by the student's home Associate Dean. Undergraduates who are registered as part-time are also subject to the above deadlines \\nto drop or withdraw from a course. Course Repeats \\nWhen a course is repeated, all grades will be recorded on the official academic transcript \\nand will be calculated in the student’s QPA. This is the case regardless if the first grade for \\nthe course is a passing or failing grade. Undergraduate students who wish to repeat a course already passed must obtain \\napproval from the student's Dean or Department Head. When a student takes a course \\ns/he has already passed, only one set of units will count towards graduation \\nrequirements. 3. University Grading Standards \\nThis grading standard is for all students classified as seeking an undergraduate degree \\nand special students taking undergraduate courses. Special students taking graduate \\ncourses will be graded on the graduate grading scale (see below). Grade \\nQuality Points \\n  \\nA \\n4.0 \\nExcellent \\nB \\n3.0 \\nGood \\nC \\n2.0 \\nSatisfactory \\nD \\n1.0 \\nPassing \\nR \\n0.0 \\nFailure \\nP \\nNon-factorable \\nPassing \\nN \\nNon-factorable \\nNot Passing \\nO \\nNon-factorable \\nAudit \\nW \\nNon-factorable \\nWithdrawal \\nI \\nNon-factorable \\nIncomplete \\n\", '57 \\n \\n \\nAD \\nNon-factorable \\nCredit granted for work completed at another \\ninstitution or by examination credit.

This grading standard is for all students classified as seeking a graduate degree and \\nspecial students taking graduate courses. ', '58 \\n \\n \\nStudents who entered Carnegie Mellon (as graduate students) prior to Fall 1995 follow \\ntheir previous graduate grading standard. Graduate students who take a leave of absence \\nand return to Carnegie Mellon will do so under the 4.33-point grading scale. These \\nstudents will have their past semester QPAs recalculated at the time of their return. No A+ may be given in an H&SS or CIT course. No D or D+ may be given in a Tepper \\ncourse. Pass/Fail policies for graduate students vary and students should be advised to \\ncheck with their individual colleges/departments/programs for details. Only Tepper and \\nMCS record W grades. Department and college policy determine minimum passing grades in graduate courses. Any course that a graduate student completes will be graded using this scale. This \\nincludes undergraduate courses taken by graduate students, and special students taking \\ngraduate courses. Handling Alleged Misconduct In Research Policy \\nStatement \\nCarnegie Mellon University is responsible for the integrity of research conducted at the \\nuniversity. As a community of scholars, in which truth and integrity are fundamental, the \\nuniversity must establish procedures for the investigation of allegations of misconduct of \\nresearch with due care to protect the rights of those accused, those making the \\nallegations, and the university. Furthermore, federal regulations require the university to \\nhave explicit procedures for addressing incidents in which there are allegations of \\nmisconduct in research. Introduction \\nThis document outlines the procedures to be followed when misconduct in research is \\nalleged at Carnegie Mellon. As defined by the National Science Foundation: [14] \\n\"Misconduct means (1) fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, or other serious deviation \\nfrom accepted practices in proposing, carrying out, or reporting results from research; (2) \\nmaterial failure to comply with Federal requirements for the protection of researchers, \\nhuman subjects, or the public or for ensuring the welfare of laboratory animals; or (3) \\nfailure to meet other material legal requirements governing research.\" \\n \\n14 National Science Foundation. 45 CFR Part 689. \"Misconduct in Science and Engineering Research,\" Federal Register. Vol. 52. No. 126. Wednesday, July 1, 1987, p. 24468. ', '59 \\n \\n \\nTo be deemed misconduct for the purposes of this policy, a \"material failure to comply \\nwith Federal requirements\" or a \"failure to meet other material legal requirements\" must \\nbe intentional or grossly negligent. In conjunction with the procedures outlined in this policy, the provost is responsible for \\ncomplying with applicable federal regulations, including notifying sponsoring agencies at \\nthe appropriate time[15] and keeping those involved, Committees of Inquiry and \\nCommittees of Investigation, well informed with respect to the requirements of these \\nagencies. If at any time it appears that the possibility exists that the alleged misconduct \\nmight involve a violation of any federal, state or local criminal statute, the university \\nattorney must be consulted immediately to determine further action. Allegations \\nQuestions about, or suspicions of, misconduct in research should be brought to the \\nattention of the provost for confidential counseling and possible informal resolution. Allegations of misconduct shall be presented to the provost in writing. Anonymous \\nreports will not be accepted. The provost will acknowledge allegations in writing to the \\nclaimant. [16] \\nAfter a review of the allegation, the provost must decide within 15 days whether a \\nCommittee of Inquiry is needed and, if so, establish such a committee promptly. The \\nclaimant must be informed, in writing, of the provost\\'s decision. If a decision is made to establish a Committee of Inquiry, the respondent[17] must be \\ninformed in writing of the allegation, advised of the initiation of the inquiry process, and \\nasked to provide information. Committee of Inquiry \\nThe provost shall appoint a three-member Committee of Inquiry. Committee members \\nshould be faculty or staff who, in the judgment of the provost, have the appropriate \\nseniority and knowledge to assess the alleged misconduct and do not have a conflict of \\ninterest that would interfere with an objective review. 15 Currently, NSF requires notification when it is decided that a formal investigation will be undertaken; however, it should be \\nborne in mind that guidelines in many agencies are currently under development, so it would be impossible to incorporate such \\nguidelines in this policy. 16 \"Claimant\" and \"respondent\" are the terms used by the Association of American Universities in their draft document, \\nFramework for Institutional Policies and Procedures for Fraud in Research, August, 1988. We have chosen to use these terms in this \\ndocument. The terms \"claimant\" and \"respondent\" in this policy stand for singular or plural, as the case may require, unless \\nqualified as \"individual claimant\" or \"individual respondent,\" respectively. ', '60 \\n \\n \\nThe provost shall charge, in writing, the Committee of Inquiry to conduct a discreet inquiry \\nbased on communication with the respondent and the claimant. The purpose of the \\ninquiry is to determine if there is reason to believe that misconduct has occurred. The \\ninquiry should be limited to activities necessary to determine whether to recommend a \\nformal investigation. The identities of the respondent and claimant will be kept confidential by members of the \\ncommittee, if possible. If a majority of the members of the committee of Inquiry recommend that a formal \\ninvestigation be conducted, the provost must establish a Committee of Investigation. If \\nonly a minority of the members of the Committee of Inquiry recommend a formal \\ninvestigation, the provost may either dismiss the allegation or establish a Committee of \\nInvestigation. If the Committee of Inquiry determines that the allegations have been made in a \\ncapricious or malicious manner, they will report this to the provost for appropriate action. The Committee of Inquiry has 30 days to conduct the inquiry. If the inquiry cannot be \\nreasonably completed within 30 days, the Committee may request a 30-day extension \\nfrom the provost. If a decision is made to establish a Committee of Investigation, the respondent must be \\ninformed of the identity of the claimant, shown all of the documents and evidence that \\nrelate to the charges, and given 15 days to respond prior to initiating the investigation. Sponsoring agencies shall be informed if appropriate or mandated. Committee of Investigation \\nThe Committee of Investigation shall have five members, none of whom was a member of \\nthe Committee of Inquiry. The provost will appoint two members. The chairmen of the \\nUniversity Research Council, the Faculty Review Committee, and the faculty will each \\nappoint one member. The provost shall charge, in writing, the Committee of Investigation to conduct a thorough \\ninvestigation of the allegation. The committee should have access to all persons and \\ninformation needed to determine the extent to which misconduct has occurred. Otherwise, the investigation should be as confidential as possible. The Committee of Investigation shall prepare a written report documenting the extent to \\nwhich misconduct has occurred. This report will be given to the provost, the respondent, \\nthe claimant, the chairman of the University Research Council, the chairman of the Faculty \\n', \"61 \\n \\n \\nReview Committee, the chairman of the faculty, the university ombudsman, and the \\npresident and, if any involved individual is a student, to the dean of Student Affairs. Optionally, the Committee of Investigation may recommend to the provost a course of \\naction based on their findings. The Committee of Investigation has 120 days to complete the investigation. If the \\ninvestigation cannot be reasonably completed within 120 days, the committee may \\nrequest a 30-day extension from the provost. Determination of Action and Appeal \\nThe provost will transmit to the president of the university the reports of the Committee \\nof Inquiry and the Committee of Investigation together with his recommendation for \\nappropriate action. When the provost's recommendation to the president calls for no action to be taken \\nagainst an individual respondent and the president concurs, as well as when the president \\ndeclines to accept a recommendation for action, the president shall, at that respondent's \\nrequest, in writing, address to that respondent a letter identifying the allegations \\ninvestigated and stating the reasons for the provost's recommendation and/or the \\npresident's decision, as appropriate. This letter shall be available for responsible use at \\nthe addressee's discretion. It shall not be included in the personnel file unless such \\ninclusion is requested, in writing, by the addressee. The president's letter must be \\nformulated, and used by the recipient, so as to preserve the confidentiality of the process, \\nand shall in particular include only information already disclosed to the addressee. For each individual respondent found responsible for misconduct, the president may \\nimpose (or request, in the case of a regular, research, or special faculty member) specific \\nsanctions, including termination of employment for a faculty or staff member and \\nexpulsion of a student. The imposition of sanctions is subject to the procedures for approval and/or appeal \\nprescribed by the Appointment and Tenure Policy for a regular, research, or special \\nfaculty member; the Staff Grievance Procedure for a staff member (or the provisions of a \\nwritten labor agreement for an employee in a bargaining unit); and the provisions of the \\nsection on Discipline in the Student Handbook for a student. Following completion of the Committee of Investigation's work and the provost's \\nrecommendation, when an individual respondent is a faculty member, if the president \\ndecides to initiate against that faculty member the procedure for dismissal for cause or \\nfor the imposition of another sanction, the procedure is then subject to the Exceptions \\n\", \"62 \\n \\n \\nprovision of the subsection Procedures of the section entitled Dismissal for Cause and \\nOther Sanctions of the Appointment and Tenure Policy, thus precluding the Ad-Hoc \\nCommittee stage. The provisions of the preceding paragraphs of this section are also applicable to \\nappropriate action regarding each individual claimant found responsible for allegations \\nmade in a capricious or malicious manner. Human Subjects in Research Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nThe university is committed to the protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects \\nin research investigations conducted under the jurisdiction of the university. The \\nuniversity believes that review independent of the investigator is necessary to safeguard \\nthe rights and welfare of human subjects of research investigations. All research involving \\nhuman subjects is conducted in accordance with federal regulations, including Title 45 of \\nthe Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46 (45 CFR 46). Under federal regulations, human \\nsubjects are defined as: living individual(s) about whom an investigator conducting \\nresearch obtains (1) data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or (2) \\nidentifiable private information. An Institutional Review Board (IRB) is established under the provost to ensure adequate \\nsafeguards. The provost is responsible for the composition of the IRB with respect to: (1) \\nthe qualifications of IRB members in terms of educational background and research or \\nother relevant experience, and (2) broad representation of relevant university interests. This IRB is responsible for reviewing investigational procedures involving human subjects \\nprior to the initiation of the research procedure in reference to (1) the rights and welfare \\nof the individuals involved, (2) the appropriateness of the methods used to obtain \\ninformed consent, and (3) the risks and potential benefits of the investigations. The IRB is \\nresponsible for determining when additional expertise is required for adequate review \\nand for obtaining that additional expertise. The IRB is further responsible for maintaining \\nrecords of its review activities and decisions and for ensuring that records of informed \\nconsent are developed and kept by investigators where appropriate. It is the responsibility of investigators who plan to use human subjects in research to \\nobtain written consent from the IRB prior to conducting an investigation involving human \\nsubjects. It is the investigator's further responsibility to take whatever steps are \\n\", '63 \\n \\n \\ndetermined necessary for the protection of the subjects, and to meet the reporting \\nrequirements established by the IRB. Intellectual Property Policy \\n1. Purpose \\nThe policy reflects the following goals: \\n• To create a university environment that encourages the generation of new knowledge \\nby faculty, staff, and students. • To facilitate wide transfer of useful inventions and writings to society. • To motivate the development and dissemination of intellectual property by providing \\nappropriate financial rewards to creators and the university, and administrative \\nassistance to creators. • To ensure that the financial return from the development of intellectual property does \\nnot distort decisions and operations of the university in a manner contrary to the \\nmission of the university. The policy is based upon the following principles relating the university to society: \\n• The mission of the university remains the generation and dissemination of knowledge. • Intellectual property will be generated within the university, and there exists an \\nobligation to disseminate it. An interface is needed if better technology transfer is to \\nbe achieved, and the university will provide mechanisms for that function.[17] \\nThe policy is based upon the following principles relating faculty, staff and students to the \\nuniversity. • Intellectual property is created by individuals, or by groups of individuals, who are \\nentitled to choose the course of disclosure; academic freedom of individuals is a \\nhigher priority than possible financial rewards. • There exists an historical tradition allowing authors to retain ownership of intellectual \\nproperty rights from textbooks and works of art. 17 This document presumes the existence of a university office to facilitate technology transfer. Such an office would serve as a \\nclearinghouse for contacts with outside partners, would perform patent and copyright tasks, and would develop an effective \\nmarketing capability. ', \"64 \\n \\n \\n• The university is the support of the whole campus community, and is thereby entitled \\nto share in financial rewards. • There should be incentives for all parties to pursue financial rewards together, \\nconsistent with the expressed goals of the policy. The distribution of these rewards \\nshould reflect, insofar as possible, the creative contributions of the creator, and the \\nresources contributed by and risks assumed by both the creator and the university in \\ndeveloping intellectual property. • Since it is frequently difficult to meaningfully assess risks, resources and potential \\nrewards, negotiated agreements are to be encouraged whenever possible. 2. Definitions \\nCertain terms are used in this document with specific meanings, as defined in this section. These definitions do not necessarily conform to customary usage. • Intellectual Property includes any patentable invention, any copyrightable subject \\nmatter, or trade secret. It also includes works of art, and inventions or creations that \\nmight normally be developed on a proprietary basis. • University means Carnegie Mellon. • Student means any full-time or part-time graduate or undergraduate student, \\nregardless of whether the student receives financial aid from the university or from \\noutside sources. It is the responsibility of students who are also employees of other \\noutside entities to resolve any conflicts between this policy and provisions of \\nagreements with their employers prior to beginning any undertaking at the university \\nthat will involve the development of intellectual property. • Faculty means members of the university's Faculty Organization as defined in the \\nFaculty Handbook, plus instructors and special faculty appointments (even in the first \\nyear), and part-time faculty. • Staff means any employee of the university other than students and faculty as defined \\nabove. If a student is also a part-time university employee, he is considered as staff \\nwith regard to intellectual property developed as a result of his employment, and as a \\nstudent with regard to other intellectual property. A full-time non-faculty employee \\nwho is also taking one or more courses is considered to be staff. Visitors to the \\nuniversity who make substantial use of university resources are considered as staff \\nwith respect to any intellectual property arising from such use. (The distinction \\nbetween faculty and staff does not affect intellectual property rights except for \\nrepresentation on the Intellectual Property Adjudication Committee [see Section 5]). \", '65 \\n \\n \\n• Creator means any person or persons who create an item of intellectual property. • Net proceeds to the university means all proceeds received by the university on \\nintellectual property that it assigns, sells or licenses, minus any application, litigation, \\ninterference, or marketing costs directly attributable to the intellectual property being \\nlicensed. Deducted costs shall be reasonable and fair, and shall be properly disclosed; \\nthe sources and amounts of compensation shall also be properly disclosed. • Net proceeds to the creator means all proceeds received by the creator from \\nintellectual property owned by him that he sells, assigns or licenses, less the costs of \\napplication, legal protection, or litigation, interference, travel and other marketing \\ncosts directly attributable to the intellectual property being exploited. Such net \\nproceeds do not include compensation legitimately received by the creator for \\nconsulting services or interest or other return on invested labor or capital. Deducted \\ncosts shall be reasonable and fair, and shall be properly disclosed; the sources and \\namounts of compensation shall also be properly disclosed. • Substantial use of university facilities means extensive unreimbursed use of major \\nuniversity laboratory, studio or computational facilities, or human resources. The use \\nof these facilities must be important to the creation of the intellectual property; merely \\nincidental use of a facility does not constitute substantial use, nor does extensive use \\nof a facility commonly available to all faculty or professional staff (such as libraries and \\noffices), nor does extensive use of a specialized facility for routine tasks. Use will be \\nconsidered \"extensive\" and facilities will be considered \"major\" if similar use of similar \\nfacilities would cost the creator more than $5000 (five thousand dollars) in constant \\n1984 dollars if purchased or leased in the public market. Creators wishing to directly \\nreimburse the University for the use of its facilities must make arrangements to do so \\nbefore the level of facilities usage for a particular intellectual property becomes \\nsubstantial. (This provision is not intended to override any other department or \\nuniversity policy concerning reimbursement for facilities usage.) \\nIn General: \\nIn any given year the equivalent figure for a particular amount of money in constant 1984 \\ndollars will be obtained by multiplying that amount of money by the ratio of the most \\nrecent quarterly Disposable Personal Income Deflator divided by the average monthly \\nDisposable Personal Income Deflator for the year 1984. As used in this policy, the masculine gender includes the feminine gender, singular or \\nplural, wherever appropriate. ', '66 \\n \\n \\n3. Policy Provisions \\nThis section states the policies concerning ownership of intellectual property created at \\nthe university. In order of precedence, ownership of intellectual property shall be as \\nfollows: \\n3-1. Externally Sponsored Work \\nOwnership Provisions: Intellectual property created as a result of work conducted under \\nan agreement between an external sponsor and the university that specifies the \\nownership of such intellectual property shall be owned as specified in said agreement. If \\nthe university declares itself to be a sponsor, but does not declare itself to be the owner of \\nthe intellectual property, ownership shall be determined in accordance with 3-6-4 below. Procedural Provisions: It is the responsibility of the Office of Sponsored Research of the \\nuniversity to inform each person whose intellectual property rights are limited by an \\nexternally sponsored contract of the intellectual property provisions of that contract in \\nadvance of the beginning of work thereon. Such notice is to be in writing and the \\nuniversity may require written acknowledgment of such provisions by any person working \\non externally sponsored projects. A summary of external sponsorship agreements limiting \\nthe intellectual property rights of potential creators will be maintained by the Office of \\nSponsored Research and will be available to the general university community. If the university fails to notify a creator, effectively and in advance, of limitations imposed \\non his intellectual property rights by external sponsorship agreements, the creator is \\nentitled to receive from the university 50% (fifty percent) of the net proceeds to the \\nuniversity resulting from his intellectual property. 3-2. Internally Sponsored Work \\nOwnership Provisions: When the university provides funds or facilities for a particular \\nproject to the extent of substantial use, it may also choose to designate itself as sponsor \\nof that work. The university may declare itself the owner of intellectual property resulting \\nfrom said work. In such cases the university must specify in advance the disposition of any \\nintellectual property rights arising from the project. If the university declares itself to be a \\nsponsor, but does not declare itself the owner of the intellectual property, ownership shall \\nbe determined in accordance with 3-6-4 below. Procedural Provisions: It is the responsibility of the Office of Sponsored Research of the \\nuniversity to inform each person whose intellectual property rights are limited by \\ninternally sponsored work of the intellectual property ownership rights specified by the \\nuniversity as to that work in advance of the beginning of work thereon. Such notice is to \\n', \"67 \\n \\n \\nbe in writing and the university may require written acknowledgment of such provisions \\nby any person working on internally sponsored projects. A summary of work for which \\nuniversity sponsorship limits the intellectual property rights of potential creators will be \\nmaintained by the Office of Sponsored Research and will be available to the general \\nuniversity community. If the university fails to notify a creator, effectively and in advance, of limitations imposed \\non his intellectual property rights by internal university sponsorship, the creator is entitled \\nto receive from the university 50% (fifty percent) of the net proceeds to the university \\nresulting from his intellectual property. 3-3. Individual Agreements \\nOwnership Provisions: Intellectual property which is the subject of a specific agreement \\nbetween the university and the creator(s) thereof shall be owned as provided in said \\nagreement. Such agreements by the university and the faculty are encouraged. Procedural Provisions: Except where limited by external sponsorship agreements, \\ncreators and the university may negotiate individual agreements to govern ownership of \\nintellectual property regardless of the applicability of any other provision hereof. 3-4. Intellectual Property Created Within Scope of Employment \\nOwnership Provisions: Intellectual property created by university employees who were \\nemployed specifically to produce a particular intellectual property shall be owned by the \\nuniversity if said intellectual property was created within the normal scope of their \\nemployment. Faculty are presumed not to be hired to produce a particular intellectual \\nproperty. On the other hand, computer programs written on the job by staff computer \\nprogrammers would fall under this provision. 3-5. Public Dedication \\nOwnership Provisions: Except when limited by subparts 3-1, 3-2, 3-3 or 3-4 above, the \\ncreator of any intellectual property may choose to place his or her creation in the public \\ndomain. In such cases both the creator and the university waive all ownership rights to \\nsaid property. Procedural Provisions: Creators wishing to place their intellectual property in the public \\ndomain are responsible for ascertaining that the right to public dedication of that \\nintellectual property is not limited by any external agreement, university sponsorship \\narrangement or terms of employment as described in Provisions 3-1, 3-2 or 3-3 above. The university provost will provide such a determination in writing upon request by the \\ncreator. It is also the creator's responsibility to ensure that disclosure does not include \\n\", '68 \\n \\n \\nvaluable intellectual property owned by others. (This provision does not release the \\nuniversity from its general obligation to notify creators of limitations to intellectual \\nproperty rights specified in Provisions 3-1 and 3-2 above.) \\nTo facilitate the actual transfer of knowledge of the intellectual property to the public at \\nlarge, the creator shall provide the university with a complete description and \\ndocumentation of the property placed in the public domain, specifically including a copy \\nof the property in the case of printed material, and complete machine-readable source \\ncode in the case of software. All such material provided to the university will be placed in \\nthe University Library and made available to the public at large. The university will take \\nappropriate action on a regular basis to publicize summary descriptions of intellectual \\nproperty recently placed in the public domain. The university will also provide any \\nmember of the general public copies of such material on a cost-recovery basis. The provisions of this section do not apply to the normal scholarly or creative publication \\nprocesses unless the creator intends to waive all proprietary rights to the publication. 3-6. In General \\nUnless governed by subparts 3-1, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4 or 3-5 above, ownership of intellectual \\nproperty created at the university shall be determined as follows: \\n3-6-1. Traditional Rights Retained \\nOwnership Provisions: In keeping with academic traditions at the university, the creator \\nretains all rights to the following types of intellectual property, without limitation: books \\n(including textbooks), educational courseware, articles, non-fiction, novels, poems, \\nmusical works, dramatic works including any accompanying music, pantomimes and \\nchoreographic works, pictorial, graphic and sculptural works, motion pictures and other \\nsimilar audio-visual works, and sound recordings, regardless of the level of use of \\nuniversity facilities. This provision does not include computer software (other than \\neducational courseware) or data bases. Procedural Provisions: The types of intellectual property listed in the preceding \\nparagraph share the attribute that they display information or visual or auditory \\nappearances which are fully revealed to the purchaser or consumer. Thus, for example, \\nsource code listings would also be considered within this category. On the other hand, \\nmost computer software and data bases do not share this attribute; they are \\ncharacterized by their capacity to perform tasks. Because of their utilitarian nature, \\nownership rights with respect thereto are governed by 3-6-3 or 3-6-4. Educational \\ncourseware is included in this provision in all cases because of its role in furthering the \\nprimary educational mission of the university. ', '69 \\n \\n \\nThis provision applies regardless of any university sponsorship of the work, and it may \\nbe modified only by a specific prior agreement between the creator and the university. The use of university-owned computers and other facilities in the preparation of books \\nand similar works does not alter this provision, though other university policies may \\nlimit such use or require reimbursement to the university. Similarly, the use of externally \\nsponsored resources does not alter this provision, unless the creator is effectively \\nnotified in advance of such limitations to his rights in accordance with 3-1. 3-6-2. No Substantial Use of University Facilities \\nOwnership Provisions: The creator owns all intellectual property created without \\nsubstantial use of university facilities, including intellectual property rights in computer \\nsoftware and data bases. 3-6-3. Substantial Use of University Facilities - No External or Internal Sponsorship \\nOwnership of intellectual property created with substantial use of university facilities, \\nbut not directly arising from externally sponsored work, or from work for which the \\nuniversity has declared itself as sponsor, shall be determined as set forth hereinafter \\ndepending on whether the creator or the university develops said property. 3-6-3-1. Development by Creator \\nOwnership Provisions: The creator originally owns intellectual property created with \\nsubstantial use of university facilities but no external or internal sponsorship, and \\nretains said ownership by commercial development of said property subject to the \\nfollowing: (i) the university shall receive 15% (fifteen percent) of the net proceeds to \\nthe creator above $25,000 (twenty-five thousand dollars) in constant 1984 dollars \\nfrom all sources (in the case of patents and copyrights, this provision shall be limited \\nto the life of the patent or copyright), and (ii) the university shall receive a perpetual, \\nnon-exclusive, non-transferrable, royalty free license to use said intellectual property. In the case of software, this license includes access by specified university personnel \\nto the source listings, and the university shall require each person to whom a \\ndisclosure is made to execute in advance a binding confidentiality agreement in favor \\nof and enforceable by the creator. If the intellectual property is created solely by a \\nstudent or students, the creator is exempt from the obligation to pay to the \\nuniversity a fraction of his net proceeds, but not from the provision of this paragraph \\nfor a non-exclusive license to the university. ', \"70 \\n \\n \\nProcedural Provisions: If the creator develops an intellectual property that is covered \\nby this provision, he must make full and fair disclosure to the University of all such \\nsources of compensation relating to that intellectual property. 3-6-3-2. Development by the University \\nOwnership Provisions: When intellectual property is created with substantial use of \\nuniversity facilities, but not directly arising from sponsored research, the creator will \\noriginally retain the rights to the property, provided that he desires to commercially \\ndevelop the property himself or to make it available to the public. If, however, the \\ncreator elects not to commercially develop same or fails to show diligence in \\npursuing such development, then the ownership rights to that property may be \\nacquired by the university. Intellectual property acquired by the university in this \\nfashion will be treated as in 3-6-4-1 below. Procedural Provisions: At the time the intellectual property is disclosed to the \\nuniversity's provost as required under Section 4-1, or at any time thereafter, the \\nuniversity may request that the creator decide whether he will develop the \\nintellectual property or will grant the rights to the university, and execute documents \\nto pass on the title. Such a decision must be made within one year of the request or \\nthe creator will automatically lose his rights in favor of the university. 3-6-4. Substantial Use of University Facilities - External or Internal Sponsorship \\nOwnership of intellectual property created with substantial use of university facilities \\nand directly arising from work sponsored under an agreement between an external \\nsponsor and the university, or from work for which the university has declared itself a \\nsponsor, but for which neither the external sponsor nor the university have specified the \\nownership of resulting intellectual property shall be determined as set forth hereinafter \\ndepending on whether the creator or the university develops said property. 3-6-4-1. Development by University \\nOwnership Provisions: The University originally owns intellectual property created \\nwith substantial use of university facilities provided by an external agreement or \\ninternal university sponsorship and retains said ownership by commercial \\ndevelopment of said property, subject to the following: in all cases, the creator shall \\nreceive 50% (fifty percent) of the net proceeds to the university. Procedural Provisions: When an intellectual property is created with substantial use \\nof university resources provided by an external research contract or a specific \\nuniversity sponsorship agreement, and when that contract or agreement either does \\n\", \"71 \\n \\n \\nnot specify the disposition of the intellectual property rights arising from that \\nsponsorship, or it permits the university and/or creator to retain or acquire such \\nintellectual property rights, the university will originally retain the rights to such \\nintellectual property. 3-6-4-2. Development by Creator \\nOwnership Provisions: When intellectual property is created with substantial use of \\nuniversity facilities provided by external or internal sponsorship, the university will \\noriginally retain the rights to the property, provided that it desires to commercially \\ndevelop the property or to make it available to the public. If, however, the university \\nelects not to commercially develop same or fails to show diligence in such \\ndevelopment, the ownership rights to that property may be acquired by the creator. Intellectual property acquired by the creator in this fashion will be treated as in 3-6-3-\\n1 above. This assignment of rights to the creator may be prohibited by the terms of \\nan external sponsorship agreement with the university or by an internal university \\nsponsorship declaration, but in such cases the creator must be notified in advance, \\nas in Provisions 3-1 and 3-2. Procedural Provisions: At the time the intellectual property is disclosed to the \\nuniversity's provost as required by Section 4-1, or at any time thereafter, the creator \\nmay request that the university decide whether it will commercially develop the \\nintellectual property or execute an assignment of the intellectual property rights to \\nthe creator. Such a decision must be made within 120 (one hundred twenty) days of \\nthe request or the university automatically waives its rights in favor of the creator, \\nand it must execute an assignment of these rights to the creator. 3-6-5. Consulting Agreements \\nOwnership Provisions: Work done by individuals as consultants to outside firms is \\npresumed not to involve unreimbursed substantial use of university facilities, and the \\nrights to intellectual property created under consulting agreements are retained by the \\noutside firms or the individual as specified by the terms of the consulting agreement \\nand the terms of Provision 3-6-2 above. Procedural Provisions: Under university policy consulting work must not make \\nsubstantial unreimbursed use of university facilities except by explicit prior agreement. Any member of the university community who is engaged in consulting work or in \\nbusiness is responsible for ensuring that provisions in his agreements are not in conflict \\nwith this policy of the university or with the university's commitments. The university's \\nInnovation Transfer Office will, upon request, provide assistance in this respect. The \\n\", \"72 \\n \\n \\nuniversity's rights and the individual's obligations to the university are in no way \\nabrogated or limited by the terms of such agreements. Each creator of intellectual \\nproperty should make his obligations to the university clear to those with whom he \\nmakes such agreements and should ensure that they are provided with a current \\nstatement of the university's intellectual property policy. Appropriate sample contract \\nwording to cover various possible external consulting arrangements shall be available \\nfrom the university provost. 4. General Procedures \\n4-1. The creator of any intellectual property that is or might be owned by the university under \\nthis policy is required to make reasonably prompt written disclosure of the work to the \\nuniversity's provost, and to execute any document deemed necessary to perfect legal \\nrights in the university and enable the university to file patent applications and \\napplications for copyright registration when appropriate. This disclosure to the provost \\nshould be made at the time when legal protection for the creation is contemplated, and it \\nmust be made before the intellectual property is sold, used for profit, or disclosed to the \\npublic. Whenever legal protection for intellectual property is anticipated all persons \\nengaged in such creative activity are encouraged to keep regular notebooks and records. 4-2. Whenever the university undertakes commercial development it shall do so, if possible, in \\na fashion that provides for the widest possible dissemination, avoiding suppression of \\ninventions from which the public might otherwise benefit, providing for non-exclusive \\nlicensing at reasonable royalties, and giving consideration to more favorable or royalty-\\nfree licensing to non-profit charitable institutions, minority businesses or enterprises in \\ndeveloping countries. 4-3. The university's share of any proceeds under this policy will be used to reimburse the \\nUniversity for its expenses for commercial development of intellectual property. Any \\nadditional return to the university will be used to further the academic purposes of all the \\ndisciplines of the entire university. 5. Resolution of Disputes \\nThis policy constitutes an understanding which is binding on the university and on the \\nfaculty, staff, and students upon whom it is effective according to the terms of Section 6 \\n\", \"73 \\n \\n \\nbelow, as a condition for participating in research programs at the university or for the \\nuse of university funds or facilities. Any question of interpretation or claim arising out of or relating to this policy, or dispute \\nas to ownership rights of intellectual property under this policy, will be settled by the \\nfollowing procedure: \\n1. The issue must first be submitted to the university's Intellectual Property \\nAdjudication Committee in the form of a letter setting forth the grievance or issue to \\nbe resolved. The committee will review the matter and then advise the parties of its \\ndecision within 60 days of submission of the letter. 2. If any of the parties to the dispute is not satisfied with the committee's decision, the \\nparty may seek binding arbitration in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and in accordance \\nwith the Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Judgment upon \\nthe award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having \\njurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator(s) will give some weight to the decision of the \\nIntellectual Property Adjudication Committee in reaching a decision. The losing party \\nof the arbitration hearing will pay for all costs of the arbitration unless the \\narbitrator(s) specifies otherwise. The Intellectual Property Adjudication Committee will consist of a chair who is a member \\nof the tenured faculty, four other members of the faculty, and four other members \\nrepresenting, respectively, the university administration, the technical staff, and the \\ngraduate and undergraduate student bodies. Initially, half of the members of the \\ncommittee (including the chair) will be appointed for two-year terms of office, and the \\nremaining half will be appointed for a one-year term. After one year new members of the \\ncommittee will be appointed for two-year terms of office. The chair will be appointed by \\nthe chair of the Faculty Senate, with the advice and consent of the Faculty Senate \\nExecutive Committee, and the remaining eight members of the committee will be \\nappointed by the president of the university or his designee. At all times at least one of \\nthe faculty members will have had significant practical experience with intellectual \\nproperty development and exploitation. The faculty members appointed by the president \\nof the university will be selected from a list of nominees prepared by the Faculty Senate or \\nits designated committee and nominees with experience in intellectual property \\ndevelopment will be identified as such by the Faculty Senate. The staff representative will \\nbe selected from a list of nominees prepared by Staff Council, and the administration \\nrepresentative will be named directly by the president of the university or his designee. The graduate student representative will be selected from a list of nominees prepared by \\n\", '74 \\n \\n \\nthe Graduate Student Organization. The undergraduate representative will be chosen \\nfrom a list of nominees prepared by the Student Senate. The committee will use the \\nguidelines set forth in this policy to decide upon a fair resolution of any dispute. If possible, the committee will also provide on request informal advisory opinions to \\ncreators and the university indicating how it is likely to interpret the provisions of this \\npolicy as it applies to special cases. 6. Effective Date of Policy \\nThis policy will become effective August 27, 1985. Once effective this policy will be binding \\non new faculty, administration, and staff when hired, and on graduate and undergraduate \\nstudents when admitted. Current faculty and staff will also become bound by this policy \\nwhen they sign new employment contracts as the result of the renewal of limited-term \\nappointments or promotion. Other university personnel, including tenured faculty, and \\ncurrent staff and students may choose to become bound by this policy for future and \\npending intellectual property by voluntary written consent. Unless the creator and the \\nuniversity agree to a different arrangement, intellectual property that is already partially \\ndeveloped at the time this policy becomes effective will be treated according to the \\nprovisions of the patent policy by which the creator is currently bound. Similarly, \\nmembers of the university working under contracts signed before the effective date of \\nthis policy who do not choose to accept this policy will remain bound by the patent \\npolicies that already apply to them. With respect to intellectual property developed during \\nthe course of employment at the university, this policy shall continue to be binding on any \\nperson whose relationship with the university becomes terminated. The university should \\ntake all administrative steps necessary to ensure that employees and students sign, upon \\ninitial employment, registration or at other appropriate times, forms that indicate their \\nacceptance of this policy. 7. Amendments of the Policy \\nAmendments of this policy may be proposed by the Faculty Senate, Staff Council or \\nuniversity administration. Proposed amendments must be approved by a two-thirds \\nmajority of votes in the Faculty Senate and subsequently approved by a simple majority of \\nvotes cast in a referendum administered by the Faculty Senate that is open to all \\nmembers of the faculty as defined by this policy and to the exempt staff, provided that \\nthis majority constitutes at least 25% (twenty-five percent) of those eligible to vote. This \\nreferendum must be preceded by an opportunity for public discussion open to all \\ninterested faculty, administration, staff and students. Amendments that are supported by \\nthe faculty and staff must then be approved by the president of the university and \\n', \"75 \\n \\n \\nadopted by the university trustees. Once adopted, amendments will become binding on \\nnew faculty, administration, and staff when hired, on existing faculty and staff when they \\nsign new employment contracts, and on graduate and undergraduate students when \\nadmitted. Other university personnel, including tenured faculty, and current staff and \\nstudents may choose to become bound by this policy for future and pending intellectual \\nproperty by voluntary written consent. Intellectual property that is already developed or \\nunder development at the time that an amendment to the policy is ratified will not be \\nbound by the terms of the amendment without the voluntary written consent of both the \\ncreator and the university. Library Policies \\nConduct \\n• Silence cell phones. Use cell phones in appropriate areas only. • Food is allowed in the Maggie Murph Café and adjacent areas only. • Students may sign up to use group study rooms in the Sorrells Engineering & Science \\nLibrary and Hunt Library. Reserve rooms online. • Informal group study is permitted in all public areas except those designated Quiet \\nStudy. Dissertations and Theses \\n• All doctoral candidates and some master's candidates must submit copies of their \\ndissertations and theses with the University Libraries. Graduate students should \\nfollow-up with their home department for details. Security \\n• Only users with Carnegie Mellon ID may be in Hunt Library after 3 a.m., Monday \\nthrough Friday. • Users must be responsible for their belongings. Never leave backpacks, laptops, cell \\nphones, or other items unattended. • Users must login to access information and/or to print documents at workstations in \\nthe library. • Users must be prepared to show photo ID if requested by library staff or university \\npolice. \", \"76 \\n \\n \\n• Backpacks, briefcases or other bags may be inspected as you exit. • Carnegie Mellon Computing Policy, Carnegie Mellon Fair Use Policy, related university \\npolicies, and state and federal laws govern legal use of information and access to \\ninformation, including security and privacy. Make-Up of Absence from Class Due to Illness \\nWhen students are ill, they are expected to negotiate with professors the time and place for \\nmake-up of assignments, tests and/or examinations missed. For students who are seriously \\nill, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs (412-268-2075) should be contacted so that the \\nstudent's academic area and/or professor may be contacted. Prenatal Radiation Exposure Policy \\nStatement \\nCarnegie Mellon University (Carnegie Mellon) complies with federal regulations to \\nminimize potentially damaging ionizing radiation exposure to the embryos/fetuses of \\ndeclared pregnant women working in radiologically restricted areas of the university. To ensure compliance, this policy mandates training for all employees and students who \\nwork in radiologically restricted areas regarding the effects of radiation on a developing \\nembryo/fetus. It also mandates a procedure, to be implemented by the radiation safety \\nofficer, for ensuring that the radiation exposure of a woman who officially declares her \\npregnancy does not exceed the level set by federal regulations. Information and Training \\nThe radiation safety officer shall provide training sessions in which all students and \\nemployees, including supervisors, who are to work in restricted radiation areas are \\ninformed, orally and in writing, about this Prenatal Radiation Exposure Policy and about \\npotential radiation and non-radiation effects on a developing embryo/fetus. At these \\nsessions, attendees are given the opportunity to have questions answered. The radiation \\nsafety officer may, at his or her discretion, administer an oral and/or written exam in \\norder to confirm attendees' understanding of the subject matter. The radiation safety officer obtains from each attendee a signed acknowledgment of \\nunderstanding of the Prenatal Radiation Exposure Policy. No employee or student may \\nenter a radiologically restricted area before attending such a training session and signing \\nsuch an acknowledgment of understanding. \", '77 \\n \\n \\nAny declared pregnant employee or student who performs work that results in radiation \\nexposure at other, non-Carnegie Mellon University locations is responsible for informing \\nthe Radiation Safety Office of those activities. Declaration of Pregnancy \\nAny employee or student who works in a radiologically restricted area of the university \\nand determines she is pregnant may officially declare her pregnancy to the radiation \\nsafety officer. To be considered an official declaration of pregnancy, this must be in \\nwriting and contain the estimated date of conception. An official declaration of pregnancy \\nform can be obtained from the radiation safety officer. A pregnant woman has no obligation to officially declare her pregnancy. Limiting Exposure \\nUpon receiving an official declaration of pregnancy, the radiation safety officer shall work \\nwith the declared pregnant woman\\'s supervisor to review the work being performed by \\nthe declared pregnant woman and determine whether exposure is likely to exceed 500 \\nmilligrams during the pregnancy and/or likely to substantially vary from month to month \\nduring the pregnancy. If exposure greater than 500 millirems or significant variation is \\ndetermined to be likely, the radiation safety officer and supervisor shall identify and \\nimplement appropriate precautions and engineering controls to limit radiation dose \\nand/or decrease month-to-month variations. The radiation safety officer shall also, upon receiving an official declaration of pregnancy, \\ncomplete a dose assessment on the declared pregnant woman, including sending her \\nwhole body radiation dosimeter to an approved laboratory for processing, and possibly \\nincluding bioassay by urinalysis. The radiation safety officer shall communicate to the \\ndeclared pregnant woman the results of the dose assessment. Once a month, the radiation safety officer shall monitor the external occupational dose to \\na declared pregnant woman using a whole body radiation dosimeter, unless the radiation \\nsafety officer considers it unlikely that the embryo/fetus will receive, from sources outside \\nthe body of the declared pregnant woman, a dose in excess of 100 milligrams during the \\ncourse of the pregnancy. The radiation safety officer shall monitor the occupational intake, by bioassay if necessary, \\nof radioactive material by a declared pregnant woman, unless the radiation safety officer \\nconsiders it unlikely that the declared pregnant woman will receive a \"Committed Effective \\nDose Equivalent\" in excess of 100 milligrams during the course of the pregnancy, in \\n', '78 \\n \\n \\naccordance with Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20, \"Standards for Protection \\nAgainst Radiation.\" \\nIf the declared pregnant woman\\'s exposure approaches 350 milligrams prior to the end of \\nthe gestation period, the radiation safety officer shall recommend to the declared \\npregnant woman and her work supervisor that she reduce her use of radioactive \\nmaterials. If the declared pregnant woman\\'s exposure reaches or exceeds 450 milligrams \\nprior to the end of the gestation period, the radiation safety officer shall notify her \\nsupervisor, remove her radiation dosimeters and rescind her authorization to use \\nradioactive material for the remainder of her pregnancy. Declared pregnant women desiring to further limit their exposure may do so. Any \\nresulting changes in work routine are to be coordinated with their work supervisor. Records \\nThe radiation safety officer shall maintain all official declarations of pregnancy and \\nexposure records in accordance with Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20, \\n\"Standards for Protection Against Radiation.\" \\nReferences \\nTitle 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 19, \"Notices, Instructions, and Reports to \\nWorkers: Inspection and Investigations.\" \\nTitle 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20, \"Standards for Protection Against \\nRadiation.\" \\nProcedure for the Appeal of Grades and Academic Actions for \\nUndergraduate Students \\nIn the event a student believes an assigned grade or an imposed academic action is incorrect \\nor not appropriate, the student may follow the processes outlined below to seek prompt and \\nequitable resolution of the matter. If a student believes a grade has been incorrectly assigned, the student should: \\n1. Present the case to the faculty member responsible for the course, providing all \\nsupporting data concerning the nature of the discrepancy. This action should be taken \\nas soon as possible but no later than one year after the final course grade was issued. 2. If, after a decision is rendered, the student believes that his or her concerns have not \\nbeen adequately resolved, the student may pursue a formal appeal with the department \\n', \"79 \\n \\n \\nresponsible for the course. To appeal to the department, a student must present a \\nwritten statement detailing the grounds for the appeal with appropriate documentation \\nto the department head of the department responsible for the course. This appeal must \\nbe within seven (7) days of the faculty member's decision. The department head will \\nprovide a written decision, including the basis for it, within thirty (30) days, or as soon \\nthereafter as practical. 3. If the student is not satisfied with the department head's resolution, the student may \\npursue the appeal at the college level. To appeal at the college level, the student must \\npresent copies of all documents originally sent to the faculty member and department \\nhead, along with a formal letter of appeal, to the dean of the college responsible for the \\ncourse. This appeal must be submitted within seven (7) days of the department head's \\ndecision. The dean, or the dean's designate, will review the appeal and will render a \\nwritten decision, including the basis for it, within thirty (30) days, or as soon thereafter as \\npractical. If a student believes an academic action is inconsistent with the policies of the college, a \\nstudent should: \\n1. Submit a formal written appeal to the associate dean of the college responsible for the \\ndecision, with a copy to the dean, requesting review of the action including all relevant \\nmaterials to substantiate the inconsistency in policy and to support their concerns. 2. The dean of the college, or the dean's designate, will review the appeal and issue a \\ndecision and the basis for it within 30 days. If, after carrying out the steps of either process described above, the student believes that \\nthe matter has not been adequately resolved, or if no decision has been rendered by the \\nappropriate date, the student may appeal at the university level. To appeal at the university \\nlevel, the student must present copies of all documents and a formal letter of appeal to the \\nprovost. The provost or another designated university officer will respond in writing with a \\nfinal resolution, including the basis for it, within thirty (30) days, or as soon thereafter as \\npractical. \", \"80 \\n \\n \\nResearch Proposals: Government, Corporations and Foundations \\nPolicy \\nPolicy Statement \\nSponsored research is an important part of the mission of the university and accounts for \\na significant portion of the university's expenditures in a given year. The large amount of \\nresearch that is supported by government, industry and foundations brings with it a \\nmyriad of constantly changing legal, financial and administrative requirements which \\nmust be taken into account. Because of the complexity of all these factors, it is important \\nthat all proposals, contracts and agreements related to research activities be reviewed \\ncentrally to ensure compliance with government regulations and university policies. Signatures and Approvals \\nIn general, research proposals require two sets of signatures: those required by the \\nfunding organization and those required by Carnegie Mellon. No proposal should be sent \\nout of the university without the appropriate signatures. All research proposals to the government and to corporations should be circulated \\ninternally and should be accompanied by a Carnegie Mellon Proposal Routing and Sign-off \\nSheet. The sign-off sheet ensures that everyone involved in the process has had the \\nopportunity to review the proposal. The following signatures are required on the sign-off sheet: \\n• Principal investigators: their signatures state that they understand their commitments \\nto the project and agree to meet their obligations as set forth in the proposal. • Deans and the department heads: their signatures attest that they support the \\nproposal and that all matters relating to space, facilities and personnel can be resolved \\nwithin the department and the college. In instances of joint proposals, signatures from \\nall department heads and deans are required. • Signatures from the Office of Sponsored Research and Provost's Office indicate that \\nthe proposal and the budget have been reviewed and that they meet the requirements \\nof both the university and the potential sponsor. Research proposals to foundations - whether initiated within the college or the \\nDevelopment Office - must also be reviewed and signed by the Provost's Office. \", \"81 \\n \\n \\nNegotiation of the Award \\nAfter an award is made to the university, the Office of Sponsored Research will enter into \\nsponsored research or contract negotiations. The principal investigator will be responsible \\nfor negotiating technical aspects of the agreement. The remainder of the negotiations will \\nbe the responsibility of the Office of Sponsored Research or the Office of the Associate \\nProvost for Research and Academic Administration. All research agreements must be \\nsigned by either the provost or the associate provost for research and academic \\nadministration. No other personnel are authorized to commit the university to a research \\nagreement. Restricted Research Policy \\nStatement \\nUniversities have two primary purposes: to create knowledge and to disseminate \\nknowledge. Carnegie Mellon University recognizes the importance of open intellectual \\ncommunication within a research group, within the university, and within the larger \\ncommunity outside. Ideally, all units of the university would disseminate the results of \\nresearch as quickly and as widely as possible. Some members or units of the university, \\nhowever, desire to do research that may be difficult or impossible without restrictions or \\nwithout access to classified or proprietary materials. There exists, therefore, a tension between the university's goal of disseminating \\nknowledge freely and the desire on the part of some of its members to conduct restricted \\nresearch on important problems. The university intends to guarantee the academic \\nfreedom of all faculty members to do research in their own manner on topics of their own \\nchoosing, provided that such research is consistent with the overall purposes of the \\nuniversity. This policy seeks to resolve the tension between the desire to participate in restricted \\nresearch and the desire to maintain the open atmosphere of the university by confining \\nrestricted research to semi-autonomous units, which are not associated with any \\nacademic departments. It thereby establishes the principle that restricted research is \\ninappropriate at Carnegie Mellon University except in the semi-autonomous units. This policy does not attempt to anticipate all possible concerns about restricted research. In some cases, decisions will need to be made about particular research projects to which \\nthe application of particular policy guidelines are not clear. In choosing to accept or \\ndecline such projects, the university will weigh the potential of a project for generating \\n\", '82 \\n \\n \\nand disseminating new knowledge, for the benefit of society, against the project\\'s \\npotential for adversely affecting the climate for research conducted in a free and open \\nenvironment. While this policy sets no explicit limits on the extent of classified research \\npermitted in the semi-autonomous units, it is not the intent of the policy to encourage any \\nunit of the university to engage in classified research as a primary ongoing activity. Indeed, it is expected that classified projects will never represent more than a small \\nfraction of the total research effort in any unit. Definitions \\n• Research: all projects and investigations involving the creation of new knowledge of a \\ntheoretical or practical nature. The term \"research\" as used here encompasses both \\n\"research\" and \"development\" as they are commonly defined. • Classified research: research, the free dissemination of the results of which is deemed \\nto jeopardize national security. The federal government controls access to the \\nenvironment in which such research is performed, restricts discussions about the work \\nin progress to individuals with clearance and a \"need to know,\" and limits publication \\nof research, results or access to data needed to verify results, for a specified period of \\ntime. • Proprietary research: research that results in intellectual property that is owned by \\nentities other than Carnegie Mellon University. Such entities may wish to market \\nproducts derived from inventions or ideas that are developed at the university. They \\nmight, therefore, desire to fund projects which restrict access to data and to \\ndiscussions about work in progress to individuals with a \"need to know,\" and to seek, \\nfor a specified period of time, a delay in publication of research results or data needed \\nto verify results. Such entities may also provide access to proprietary material, which \\nresearchers must agree not to include in publications. • Publication: oral or written dissemination. • Restricted research: includes all classified research, and any proprietary or other \\nresearch that requires more than a six month delay in publication of the research \\nresults. • Semi-autonomous units: units of the university specifically so designated by the \\npresident, after consultation with the URC and the Faculty Senate, currently the Mellon \\nInstitute and the Software Engineering Institute. • Non-autonomous units: all university entities other than semi-autonomous units. ', \"83 \\n \\n \\nRestricted Research in Non-Autonomous Units \\nIt is the policy of Carnegie Mellon that restricted research is inappropriate and, therefore, \\nnot permitted within its non-autonomous units. It is also the policy of Carnegie Mellon not to permit involvement of students in projects \\nwhich carry restrictions that may impede their progress toward a degree. Therefore, \\nstudents should not be involved in contracts that require the delay of a student's \\npublication of research results when such results are intended for use in obtaining \\nacademic credit, except that a sponsor may require a delay of thirty days for review of \\npublications for removal of proprietary information that was provided by the sponsor for \\nthe conduct of the research. Proprietary research is allowed within non-autonomous units provided it is subject to \\nlimitations (excluding students' publications as noted above) no more stringent than the \\nfollowing: \\n• A sponsor may request a delay of up to six months in publication so that steps may be \\ntaken to secure intellectual property rights to inventions or ideas developed under the \\ncontract. • A sponsor may require a delay of thirty days for review of publications for removal of \\nproprietary information which was provided for the conduct of the research. Considerations for Faculty/Researchers \\nThe university recognizes that problems arise in both restricted research and research \\nthat is not itself restricted but that involves access to classified or propriety information or \\nmaterials (hereinafter, restricted materials). Researchers may also have access to \\nrestricted materials when serving as consultants. Access to restricted materials gives rise \\nto concerns about limitations on researchers' freedom to communicate. In such instances, \\nresearchers must exercise considerable judgment to conduct their research in an open \\nenvironment while protecting the restricted materials to which they have access. Researchers must also be aware that the university will judge their performance as \\nresearchers through their publications or through other scholarly products that arise \\nfrom their research. Research that is restricted in dissemination, or not available for \\npublic review, cannot be considered in promotion or reappointment decisions or in \\nevaluations of academic performance of any kind. Considerations for Students \\nThere are important concerns about the involvement of students in restricted research. It \\nis necessary for students to publish their work in order to obtain degrees, course credit \\n\", \"84 \\n \\n \\nand professional recognition. Students rely to a large degree on their faculty advisor's \\njudgment for guidance and advice. Research that is restricted in dissemination, or not \\navailable for public review, cannot be used for academic credit. Thus, before working on \\nsuch research, a student must be notified in writing that work on this research may not be \\nused for academic credit. Restricted Research in Semi-Autonomous Units \\nThe semi-autonomous units associated with Carnegie Mellon may conduct restricted \\nresearch. Faculty members may conduct restricted research in or in cooperation with semi-\\nautonomous units only on a consulting basis or by means of a formal, internal leave of \\nabsence from their non-autonomous units. Work that is restricted in any way may not be used for academic evaluations until it is \\nreleased for publication, and then only with respect to future academic actions. Students may occasionally be employed by the semi-autonomous units, provided that \\nsuch employment does not interfere substantially with progress toward a degree. However, they must be made aware that work that is restricted cannot be used for \\nacademic credit. Work that was restricted and is later released for dissemination and \\nreview can be applied toward future academic credit. Students should be discouraged \\nfrom working on restricted research in which dissemination may be delayed indefinitely. Guidelines for all Units \\nWork by students on restricted research projects shall not be made a condition for \\nadmission or financial aid. The principal investigator is responsible for informing all members of a project (faculty, \\nstaff and students) of any restrictions imposed on the dissemination of information \\nrelated to the research. This must be done prior to the start of the project or prior to an \\nindividual joining an existing project. Restrictions on access to university facilities due to the conduct of restricted research \\nmust be kept to a minimum. Access to and movement through the facilities in which \\nrestricted research is conducted must be consistent with standard university procedures. The Provost's Office is responsible for obtaining signed documents from principal \\ninvestigators on restricted research projects attesting that they are aware of all \\nrestrictions imposed on the research and that they have informed all participants of these \\nrestrictions. \", \"85 \\n \\n \\nThe Office of Sponsored Research shall review all proposals and contracts prior to \\napproval for conformity with these guidelines. Any that do not meet these guidelines will \\nbe referred to the University Research Council (URC) for review and recommendation of \\nappropriate action to the provost. To maintain a balance with the university's goals of broad dissemination of knowledge, \\nthe URC will conduct an annual review of all restricted research being conducted at the \\nuniversity. This review will be made based on a listing of all contracts that involve \\nrestricted research. This listing shall include the title and sponsor(s) of the research, \\nname(s) of principal investigator(s), and the amount of funding of each contract. The university community will be informed annually, through the URC's written report to \\nthe Faculty Senate and Student Senate, of the nature and overall impact of restricted \\nresearch at Carnegie Mellon. Existing sponsored research projects shall be allowed to continue under the terms of their \\npresent contract. However, renewal contracts must conform with this policy. Retention of Student Work Policy \\nThe university reserves the right in all colleges to retain indefinitely any student work the \\nfaculty may select. All work not retained by the university must be claimed at the time \\nspecified on the bulletin boards (or other forms of communication) of the department \\nconcerned; otherwise, the work will be destroyed. Statute of Limitations – Master’s Studies \\nStudents will complete all requirements for the master’s degree within a maximum of seven \\nyears from original matriculation as a master’s student, or less if required by a more \\nrestrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the \\nperson may resume work towards a master’s degree only if newly admitted to a currently \\noffered master’s degree program under criteria determined by that program. Under extenuating circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family \\nor parental leave, or temporary disability, a college/school may, upon the relevant \\ndepartment's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), \\ndefer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students \\nwho are pursuing the master’s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their \\nprogram, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for \\nextension of the time to degree limit. \", \"86 \\n \\n \\nStatute of Limitations – Undergraduate Students \\nAll units required for an undergraduate degree, whether earned in residence, transferred \\nfrom another institution or granted via advanced placement, must have been earned within \\neight years of the date on which the degree is granted. This statutory period can be extended \\nby the dean of the student's college under the following conditions: \\n• the courses taken prior to the statutory period still represent a reasonable part of the \\nstudent's total academic program; \\n• the prior courses provide adequate preparation for courses which must still be taken to \\nfulfill the degree requirements; \\n• there is a legitimate reason(s) for the student not completing the academic program \\nwithin the statutory period. A request for a waiver of the statute of limitations must be submitted to the dean of the \\nstudent's college. The request for a waiver should address all of the above conditions for an \\nextension. For cases in which a waiver is granted, the waiver covers specific courses and is \\nintended for a specific period during which the program must be completed. Student Leaves Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nStudents must sometimes interrupt their studies for a variety of reasons (financial, \\nacademic or personal). Students choosing to take a leave of absence must first contact \\ntheir department advisor to discuss their plans while on leave to work out any conditions \\nthat may be necessary for a smooth return to Carnegie Mellon. A student may leave Carnegie Mellon by either withdrawing from the university (this \\nmeans leaving the university with no intention of returning) or by taking a leave of \\nabsence (this means leaving the university temporarily, with the firm and stated intention \\nof returning). A Leave of Absence Form must be completed by all students requesting a leave of \\nabsence. A Withdrawal Form must be completed by all students who are withdrawing. Notifying instructors or no longer attending classes does not complete the process. Forms \\nare available on The HUB website. Not completing the leave form results in tuition being \\ncharged to midpoint of the semester or the last date the student attended an \\nacademically-related activity such as an exam, tutorial or study group, or the last day a \\nstudent turned in a class assignment. \", \"87 \\n \\n \\nStudents are required to fill out all information on the form, including all comment \\nsections relating to reasons for their leave of absence. After completion of the form, \\nstudents must take it to their home department and dean's office for appropriate \\nsignatures. The process of taking a leave will not be complete until all necessary \\nsignatures are on the leave form. Under certain circumstances, students may also need \\nthe Dean of Student Affairs to sign off on the leave form. International students who are \\nhere on a F1 or J1 visa must consult the Office of International Education for information \\non possible visa implications prior to going on leave. Students on leave are not permitted to live in university housing, attend classes or \\nmaintain employment as students at Carnegie Mellon while their leave is in effect. Doctoral candidates in ABD (All But Dissertation) status who wish to take a leave of \\nabsence should refer to the Doctoral Student Status policy. Leaves during the academic semester will take effect as of the date signed by the \\nstudent's dean. After the Leave of Absence or Withdrawal Form is received by the \\nUniversity's Registrar's Office, it will be reviewed for the appropriate tuition refunds (see \\nEnrollment Services: Tuition and Fees Adjustment Policy) and grade implications. The \\nrecording of student courses and grades for taking a leave in a semester follows the \\ndeadlines for semester or mini courses, as follows: \\n• On or before the university semester course drop deadline: all courses and grades are \\nremoved. • After the university semester course drop deadline through the last day of classes: W \\n(withdrawal) grades will be assigned to all classes. (W grades apply to all \\nundergraduate students, and graduate students in the Carnegie Institute of \\nTechnology, the Heinz College, the Mellon College of Science and the Tepper School of \\nBusiness.) \\n• After the last day of classes: Permanent grades assigned by the instructor will be \\nrecorded. Student Parental Accommodation Protocols \\nProviding holistic student support is a top priority at Carnegie Mellon. The protocols on this \\npolicy are designed to support the parental needs of students and their families. Students seeking any of the Parental Accommodations described below must register with \\nthe Office of the Dean of Student Affairs by contacting the office for an appointment by \\ncalling 412-268-2075. \", '88 \\n \\n \\nStudents are encouraged to register with the Office of the Dean of Students ninety (90) days \\nin advance of the anticipated arrival of the child as applicable in the individual circumstance. At the time of registering, students will have the opportunity to consult about resources, \\nprocedures, funding options and preparation for discussing academic accommodations with \\nthe student’s academic department. Students should also consult with their academic \\nadvisors either before or in conjunction with registering with the Office of the Dean of \\nStudents. Accommodations for Gestational Parents \\nThe birth of a child is a significant life event that may require time away from academic \\npursuits for delivery and recovery from delivery of a newly born child. Students whose \\nanticipated delivery date is during the course of a semester may need to take time away \\nfrom their academic responsibilities. Carnegie Mellon students seeking time away are \\nafforded two options as possible accommodation: \\n• Short-Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents – A short term absence from \\nacademic responsibilities up to a maximum of six (6) weeks. Short-Term \\nAccommodation may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, where \\na longer absence is medically necessary. Prior to the absence students must work with \\nrelevant university faculty and staff to adjust their course work, research, teaching and \\nother academic responsibilities during the period of absence. This may include \\nextensions of time to complete assignments, incomplete grades, and/or dropping \\ncourses, shifting research responsibilities and adjusting TA assignments. Students who \\ntake a Short-Term Accommodation will remain enrolled. • Formal Leave of Absence– A formal leave of absence under the Student Leaves Policy. Generally, the Student Leave Policy permits students to take a leave of absence for a full-\\nsemester, mini-semester, or for the time remaining in the semester during which the \\nleave is taken. Students who take a Formal Leave of Absence drop all remaining courses \\nfor the semester and are unenrolled for the semester. International students must \\nconsult with the Office of International Education before considering this option due to \\nvisa implications. Parental Accommodation for Doctoral Students \\nThe university offers a Parental Accommodation for qualifying doctoral student parents to \\ninclude up to four (4) weeks of time away from academic responsibilities with continued \\nstipend support. This accommodation can be utilized within six months of the birth or \\nplacement of a child through adoption, foster care or legal guardianship. Gestational \\n', '89 \\n \\n \\nparents may utilize both the Short-Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents and the \\nparental accommodation. Careful planning and consultation is necessary given the unique contexts and \\nrequirements of each student’s situation. Students will remain fully enrolled and will \\nreceive assistance in navigating the necessary planning and consultation processes. Financial Assistance for Student Parents \\nCarnegie Mellon also offers the following options for financial assistance to students who \\nbecome parents while enrolled: \\n• Interest Free Loan – Any student who becomes a parent is eligible to apply for an \\ninterest-free Parental Loan from the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs. • Doctoral Stipend Continuation (Gestational Parents) – Doctoral students who are the \\ngestational parent and who receive an academic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon are \\neligible to continue to receive stipend funding for up to six (6) weeks during a Short-\\nTerm Accommodation for Gestational Parents or during a Formal Leave of Absence. Continued academic stipend funding may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of \\neight (8) weeks, if an absence longer than six weeks is medically necessary. • Doctoral Stipend Continuation (Non-gestational Parents) – Doctoral students who \\nreceive an academic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon and are becoming a parent by \\nadoption, birth, or through guardianship are eligible to continue to receive stipend \\nfunding for up to four (4) weeks during a Short-Term Parental Accommodation. Lactation Rooms \\nAs a service to our community members, Carnegie Mellon offers several lactation rooms for \\nthe purpose of expressing milk while on campus. These spaces are open to all CMU \\ncommunity members and their guests. More information available here. Sponsored ID cards \\nAvailable as a courtesy to student spouses/registered domestic partners and visiting/non-\\ndegree students. Learn more. Domestic Partner Registration \\nEligible students may elect benefits for their domestic partners by following the registration \\nprocedure available via this link.

Student Privacy Rights Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nUnder the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), you have the right to: \\n• inspect and review your education records; \\n• request an amendment to your education records if you believe they are inaccurate or \\nmisleading; \\n• request a hearing if your request for an amendment is not resolved to your satisfaction; \\n• consent to disclosure of personally identifiable information from your education records, \\nexcept to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without your consent; \\n• file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education Family Policy Compliance Office if \\nyou believe your rights under FERPA have been violated. 1. Inspection \\nWhat are education records? Education records are records maintained by the university that are directly related to \\nstudents. These include biographic and demographic data, application materials, course \\nschedules, grades and work-study records. The term does not include: \\n• information contained in the private files of instructors and administrators, used only as a \\npersonal memory aid and not accessible or revealed to any other person except a \\ntemporary substitute for the maker of the record; \\n• Campus Police records; \\n• employment records other than work-study records; \\n• medical and psychological records used solely for treatment purposes; \\n• records that only contain information about individuals after they have left the university; \\n• any other records that do not meet the above definition of education records. ', \"91 \\n \\n \\nHow do I inspect my education records? • Complete an Education Inspection and Review Request Form [pdf] and return it to The \\nHUB in order to notify the University Registrar's Office. • The custodian of the education record you wish to inspect will contact you to arrange a \\nmutually convenient time for inspection, not more than 45 days after your request. The custodian or designee will be present during your inspection. • You will not be permitted to review financial information, including your parents' \\nfinancial information; or confidential letters of recommendation, if you have waived \\nyour right to inspect such letters. • You can get copies of your education records from the office where they are kept for \\n25 cents per page, prepaid. 2. Amendment \\nHow do I amend my educational records? • Send a written, signed request for amendment to the University Registrar, Carnegie \\nMellon University, A19 Warner Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15213. Your request should specify \\nthe record you want to have amended and the reason for amendment. • The university will reply to you no later than 45 days after your request. If the \\nuniversity does not agree to amend the record, you have a right to a hearing on the \\nissue. 3. Hearing \\nHow do I request a hearing? • Send a written, signed request for a hearing to the University Registrar, Carnegie Mellon \\nUniversity, A19 Warner Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15213. The university will schedule a hearing \\nno later than 45 days after your request. How will the hearing be conducted? • A university officer appointed by the Vice President for Campus Affairs, who is not \\naffiliated with your enrolled college will conduct the hearing. • You can bring others, including an attorney, to the hearing to assist or represent you. If \\nyour attorney will be present, you must notify the university ten days in advance of the \\nhearing so that the university can arrange to have an attorney present too, if desired. \", \"92 \\n \\n \\n• The university will inform you of its decision, in writing, including a summary of the \\nevidence presented and the reasons for its decision, no later than 45 days after the \\nhearing. • If the university decides not to amend the record, you have a right to add a statement \\nto the record that explains your side of the story. 4. Disclosure \\nCarnegie Mellon generally will not disclose personally identifiable information from your \\neducation records without your consent except for directory information and other \\nexceptions specified by law. What is directory information? Directory information is personally identifiable information of a general nature that may \\nbe disclosed without your consent, unless you specifically request the university not to do \\nso. It is used for purposes like compiling campus directories. If you do not want your directory information to be disclosed, you must notify the University \\nRegistrar's Office, in writing, within the first 15 days of the semester. Notifying the University Registrar's Office covers only the disclosure of centralized \\nrecords. Members of individual organizations such as fraternities, sororities, athletics, etc. must also notify those organizations to restrict the disclosure of directory information. Carnegie Mellon has defined directory information as the following: \\n• your full name \\n• local/campus address \\n• local/campus telephone number \\n• email user id and address  \\n(User ids cannot be completely suppressed from our electronic systems.

Student Return Policy \\nStudents on leave wishing to return to Carnegie Mellon to resume their degree studies may \\ndo so under several conditions. In order to be considered for return from leave, a student \\nmust first obtain an Application for Return form from The HUB or their academic \\ndepartment. This application requires information from the student regarding the intended \\n', \"95 \\n \\n \\nsemester of return, current address information and information about their leave. This \\napplication must be submitted to their home department at least one month prior to the \\nbeginning of the semester. Undergraduates may return within their same academic department within two years. After \\ntwo years, students returning in the same academic department are subject to space \\nconstraints and academic performance review. Graduate students must negotiate their \\nreturn with their home department and must follow their department policy. The Application for Return requires approval of the student's academic department and \\ndean. If a student's department chooses to deny the student's Application for Return, the \\nstudent may appeal to their dean. Any constraints governing the student's eligibility to return \\nwill be specified directly on the application by the academic department and/or dean's office \\nor the Office of Student Affairs. Students who have taken courses elsewhere must submit an official transcript and course \\ndescriptions with their Application for Return. Transfer credit approval is determined by the \\nacademic department based on course level, performance and appropriateness to the \\nstudent's curriculum requirements. Credit transfer is subject to college-specific policy. Failure \\nto submit the necessary documents at the time of return will result in denial of transfer \\ncredit. The process of returning is not completed until all necessary signatures on the Return form \\nare obtained by the student and until all outstanding bills are paid. Enrollment Services will \\nthen notify the appropriate university offices of the student's return. Students’ Rights Policy \\nThe primary right of students is to pursue their education so long as they maintain their \\neligibility to remain a member of the community by meeting its academic standards and so \\nlong as they observe the regulations imposed by the university for the governance of the \\nacademic community. The second right of students is to be recognized as members of the student body, with all the \\nprivileges pursuant thereto as to use of physical plant, university services and facilities. Every student has the constitutional rights and responsibilities of any citizen under the law. Conversely, a responsibility of any student is to respect these rights of any other member of \\nthe university community. A student has the right to expect that academic and professional processes should be flexible \\nand periodically open to review and to participate constructively with faculty and \\n\", \"96 \\n \\n \\nadministration in those processes by which the university community maintains the \\nexcellence of the standards of its curriculum and methods of instruction and the viability of \\nits total educational program. The student has the right to recourse through the procedures outlined in The Word/Student \\nHandbook against unreasonable academic action. Student Suspension/Required Withdrawal Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nUniversity Suspension is a forced, temporary leave from the university. There are three \\ntypes of suspension for students that apply to both graduate and undergraduate \\nstudents: \\nAcademic Suspension is the result of poor academic performance or violation of academic \\nregulations and is imposed by the student's college or academic department (see \\nuniversity and college academic policies). Disciplinary Suspension is the result of serious personal misconduct and is imposed by the \\nOffice of Student Affairs (see The Word: Student Handbook). Administrative Suspension is the result of failure to meet university financial obligations or \\nfailure to comply with federal, state or local health regulations and is imposed by \\nEnrollment Services. (See Student Accounts Receivable Collection Policy and Procedures \\nfor financial obligations. Contact University Health Services for information about health \\nregulations.) \\nSuspended students may not: \\n• register for courses \\n• attend classes \\n• live in student or fraternity/sorority housing \\n• use campus facilities, including athletic facilities, library and computer clusters \\n• participate in student activities \\n• be members of student organizations \\n• have student jobs \\n(Note: students on academic suspension may have a summer campus job if they accepted \\nthe job before they were suspended.) \\n\", \"97 \\n \\n \\nEmployment \\nAlthough suspended students may not hold student jobs, students on academic \\nsuspension may, under certain circumstances, have a non-student job with the university; \\nstudents on disciplinary or administrative suspension may not. To have a non-student job, students on academic suspension must receive approval from \\ntheir associate dean (undergraduate students) or department head (graduate students) to \\nensure that the job will not violate their suspension terms. Students in violation of this will \\nlose their degree student status, meaning they would have to reapply for admission to \\nCarnegie Mellon through either Undergraduate Admission or the appropriate graduate \\ndepartment. Transfer Credit \\nSuspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer \\ncredit only if their college's and department's policies allow this. Appeals \\nTo appeal any action of this policy, the student may write to the following people: \\nAcademic Suspension - associate dean (undergraduate students) or department head \\n(graduate students); \\nDisciplinary Suspension - dean of student affairs; \\nAdministrative Suspension - vice president for enrollment, vice president for business and \\nplanning, and the dean of student affairs, in consultation with the student's associate \\ndean. Returning from Suspension \\nIn order to return from a suspension, a student must have the following approval: \\nAcademic Suspension - associate dean (undergraduate students) or department head \\n(graduate students); \\nDisciplinary Suspension - dean of student affairs; \\nAdministrative Suspension - vice president for campus affairs or designate. \", \"98 \\n \\n \\nSummary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures \\nIntroduction \\nSet forth below is a summary of the processes available to graduate students who seek \\nreview of academic and non-academic issues. Generally, graduate students are expected \\nto seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit or \\nprogram before invoking formal processes. When an informal resolution cannot be \\nreached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow \\nthese formal procedures. To the extent that these processes are set forth in official \\nUniversity policies, links to those statements of policy and more detailed description of \\nprocesses and procedures are included. Where a graduate student's concerns implicate \\nmultiple policies or processes, the University reserves the right to decide which process \\nshall apply in order to avoid duplicative and potentially conflicting processes and \\ndecisions, or in appropriate circumstances, the order in which multiple reviews may occur. These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs \\nof the University. Students should refer to the online handbooks (or hard copy \\nhandbooks if applicable) for their particular programs for more detailed information \\nabout the administration and academic policies of the program. To the extent that these \\npolicies conflict in any way with policies, processes and procedures adopted at the \\nCollege, Department or Program level, the policies set forth herein shall govern. Appealing Final Grades \\nFinal grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval \\nof the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of sound \\ndiscretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the \\ninstructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual \\nexceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is \\nbased on manifest error (e.g. a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade \\nor failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who \\nassigned the grade did so in violation of a University policy. A graduate student who believes a final grade was assigned pursuant to (a) or (b) above \\nshould first present the case informally to the faculty or staff member responsible for the \\ncourse in which the student believes an inappropriate grade has been awarded. Grade \\nappeals should be initiated as soon as possible but no later than one year after the final \\ncourse grade was issued. If the student is not satisfied with the resolution at this first \\nstep, the student shall submit a formal, written appeal, with appropriate documentation \\n\", '99 \\n \\n \\nto the head of the department in which the course was offered. The department head (or \\nthe program head if the department head chooses to delegate the decision to him/her) \\nwill issue a written decision on the appeal within 30 days, or as soon thereafter as \\npractical. If the student is not satisfied with the decision of the department head (or \\nprogram head), the student may submit a formal, written appeal, with appropriate \\ndocumentation, within seven (7) days to the Dean of the college in which the course is \\noffered. The Dean shall render a decision within 30 days, or as soon thereafter as \\npractical. The decision of the Dean shall be final and not appealable. Summary of Levels of Appeal for Final Grades: \\n• Informal discussion with the faculty member \\n• Formal written appeal to the department head (or the program head if the department \\nhead chooses to delegate the decision to him/her) \\n• Formal written appeal to the Dean \\n• Dean issues final non-appealable decision \\nSee, also, Carnegie Mellon University Grading Policies. Appeal of Academic Actions \\nAn \"Academic Action\" is an action by a program, unit or department based on a graduate \\nstudent\\'s academic performance or failure to satisfy academic program requirements. Examples of Academic Actions include, but are not limited to, academic probation, \\nacademic suspension, and dismissal/drop. Each college, department, or program may set \\nits own academic requirements and standards for acceptable academic performance. These standards and benchmarks for performance are set forth in the online and/or hard \\ncopy handbooks for individual graduate programs. Graduate students will be notified of an academic action in writing by the applicable \\ndepartment, unit, or program head or director, or designated committee. Graduate \\nstudents are encouraged to seek informal resolution of any concerns related to academic \\nactions informally within the department, unit or program before filing a formal appeal. Graduate students who wish to appeal an Academic Action must submit a formal, written \\nappeal, with appropriate documentation, to the Dean of the College within seven (7) \\ncalendar days after receipt of written notice of the academic action by the department, \\nunit, or program head or director, or designated committee. The Dean may delegate \\nreview of the matter to another individual or committee, including but not limited to one \\nof the Associate Deans, the College Council or a specially constituted grievance committee \\n', \"100 \\n \\n \\nwho shall make a recommendation to the Dean. The Dean shall render a decision on the \\nappeal within thirty (30) days or as soon thereafter as practical. Graduate students who wish to appeal the written decision of the Dean must submit a \\nformal written appeal, with appropriate documentation, to the Provost within fourteen \\n(14) calendar days after receipt of the Dean's decision. A copy of the appeal must also be \\nsubmitted to the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Education and to the Dean. The \\nProvost may delegate review of the matter to another individual or committee, including \\nbut not limited to the Vice Provost for Education who shall make a recommendation to \\nthe Provost. The Provost shall render a decision on the appeal within thirty (30) days or as \\nsoon thereafter as practical. Decisions by the Provost are final and not appealable. Generally, sanctions resulting from an Academic Action (e.g. probation, suspension, or \\ndismissal /drop) take effect immediately, regardless of whether an appeal is filed. In \\nexceptional circumstances, however, the appropriate Dean or the Provost may elect to \\nhold sanctions in abeyance pending the resolution of an appeal. Summary of Levels of Appeal for Academic Actions: \\n• Seek informal resolution within department, unit, or program \\n• Formal written appeal to the Dean \\n• Decision rendered by the Dean \\n• Formal written appeal to the Provost  \\n• Provost issues final non-appealable decision \\nAppeal from Academic Disciplinary Actions \\nAcademic Disciplinary Actions are sanctions and outcomes imposed when any student \\nviolates the University Policy on Academic integrity including cheating, plagiarism an \\nunauthorized assistance. The Office of Community Standards and Integrity manages the Academic Disciplinary \\nProcess and provides resources to all students, faculty and staff. The process for \\nappealing an academic integrity violation can be found under the Academic Disciplinary \\nActions Index. Community Standards Violations \\nAs members of the University community, Carnegie Mellon students are expected to \\nrespect the rights of all students, faculty and staff and adhere to the policies outlined in \\n\", \"101 \\n \\n \\nthe Student Handbook contained in The Word, the University Policies website, and any \\napplicable college, department or graduate program handbooks. If a student has observed a violation of university policy or law, or feels harmed by \\nanother student's misconduct (e.g. affecting his/her welfare, property, safety or security) \\nhe/she should file a report with the Dean of Student Affairs and/or University Police as \\nappropriate. The procedures for adjudicating community standards violations and for appealing the \\nresults are available in The Word under Community Standards. For more information about community standards and disciplinary procedures, please \\nvisit the Community Standards website. Summary of Levels of Appeal for Community Standards Violations \\nHarassment \\nCarnegie Mellon is firmly committed to intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry and \\nexpression and respect for the dignity of each individual. Acts of harassment or \\nintimidation by a student toward any member of the campus community will not be \\ntolerated. Graduate students with concerns or grievances related to harassment or \\nintimidation by another student should contact the Dean of Student Affairs for resolution. Acts of harassment or intimidation by a student may be referred to the University \\nCommittee on Discipline. Graduate Students with concerns or grievances related to alleged harassment or \\nintimidation by a staff member, faculty member or other member of the campus \\ncommunity should contact the Assistant Vice President of Human Resources, People & \\nOrganizational Effectiveness at 412-268-9685 for resolution. Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault \\nGraduate student grievances or concerns relating to sexual harassment will be handled \\naccording to the University's Policy against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault. Any \\nmember of the university community, whether faculty member, student, or staff member, \\nwho believes she or he has been the victim of sexual harassment and/or sexual assault or \\nis aware of such conduct, is encouraged to make contact with any of the individuals \\nidentified in the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) under Section V.B. They will make \\ncertain that your complaint is communicated to the appropriate resource for handling. \", \"102 \\n \\n \\nIntellectual Property Disputes \\nDisputes concerning rights to intellectual property must be resolved according to the \\nprocedures set forth in the University's Intellectual Property Policy. Research Misconduct \\nCarnegie Mellon University is responsible for the integrity of research conducted at the \\nUniversity. As a community of scholars, in which truth and integrity are fundamental, the \\nUniversity has established procedures for the investigation of allegations of misconduct of \\nresearch with due care to protect the rights of those accused, those making the \\nallegations, and the University. The procedures for handling allegations of research \\nmisconduct are set forth in the Policy for Handling Alleged Misconduct in Research at \\nCarnegie Mellon University. For graduate students found responsible for research misconduct, the President of the \\nUniversity may impose specific sanctions up to and including expulsion. The imposition of \\nsanctions is subject to the procedures for approval and/or appeal prescribed for \\ncommunity standards violations. Return from Leave of Absence \\nGraduate students who wish to return to Carnegie Mellon following a leave of absence \\nmust follow the procedures set forth in the Student Return Policy. Generally, graduate students must negotiate their return to the University with their \\nhome academic department and follow any applicable departmental policies. If a \\ndepartment chooses to deny a student's return from a leave of absence, the student may \\nappeal to the Dean of the College. Suspension/Required Withdrawal \\nA University Suspension is a forced, temporary leave from the university. There are three \\ntypes of suspension for students that apply to both graduate and undergraduate \\nstudents: \\n• Academic Suspension is the result of poor academic performance or violation of \\nacademic regulations and is imposed by the student's college or academic department \\n(see university and college academic policies). • Disciplinary Suspension is the result of serious personal misconduct and is imposed by \\nthe Dean of Student Affairs (see The Word/Student Handbook). • Administrative Suspension is the result of failure to meet university financial \\nobligations or failure to comply with federal, state or local health regulations and is \\n\", '103 \\n \\n \\nimposed by Enrollment Services. (See Student Accounts Receivable Collection Policy \\nand Procedures for financial obligations. Contact Student Health Services for \\ninformation about health regulations.) \\nGraduate students who wish to appeal a suspension or required withdrawal may write to \\nthe following individuals depending on the type of suspension: \\n• Academic Suspension – The applicable department, unit, or program head \\n• Disciplinary Suspension – Dean of Student Affairs \\n• Administrative Suspension –Vice President for Enrollment, Vice President for Business \\nand Planning, and the Dean of Student Affairs, in consultation with the student’s \\nAssociate Dean \\nFor more details see the Student Suspension/Required Withdrawal Policy. General Grievances \\nThe following grievance procedures are to be used for graduate student problems or \\nconcerns that are not covered by any of the policies or procedures set forth above. As \\nsuch, these grievance procedures may not be used as a substitute for procedures \\ncontemplated under any other policy, including but not limited to, policies regarding \\nacademic actions; academic disciplinary actions; community standards; harassment; \\nsexual harassment; intellectual property; research misconduct or any other policy. Graduate students are expected to discuss any concerns or grievances initially with the \\nfaculty or staff member(s) involved. Students are strongly encouraged to seek informal \\nresolution of grievances through consultations within the academic unit, department or \\nprogram. Students may also seek assistance with the informal resolution of a grievance \\nthrough the Vice Provost for Education. If a grievance cannot be resolved informally with the faculty or staff member involved \\nwithin the academic department, a student may submit a formal, written grievance to the \\nhead of the department, unit or program. If there is more than one student with a \\ngrievance on a particular matter, each student must submit a separate grievance. The \\ndepartment, unit, or program head, or director or designated committee will issue a \\nwritten decision on the grievance within thirty (30) days or as soon thereafter as practical. Graduate students who wish to appeal from the decision rendered at the department, \\nunit or program level must submit a formal, written appeal to the Dean of the College \\nwithin seven (7) calendar days after receipt of written notice of the decision by the \\ndepartment, unit, or program head, or director or designated committee. The Dean may \\ndelegate review of the matter to another individual or committee, including but not \\n', \"104 \\n \\n \\nlimited to one of the Associate Deans, the College Council or a specially constituted \\ngrievance committee who shall make a recommendation to the Dean. The Dean shall \\nrender a decision on the appeal within thirty (30) days or as soon thereafter as practical. Graduate students who wish to appeal the written decision of the Dean must submit a \\nformal written appeal to the Provost within seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the \\nDean's decision. A copy of the appeal must also be submitted to the Vice Provost for \\nEducation and to the Dean. The Provost may delegate review of the matter to another \\nindividual or committee, including but not limited to the Vice Provost for Education who \\nshall make a recommendation to the Provost. The Provost shall render a decision on the \\nappeal within thirty (30) days or as soon thereafter as practical. Decisions by the Provost \\nare final and not appealable. Summary of Levels of Appeal for General Grievances: \\n• Seek informal resolution within department, unit, or program \\n• Formal review by the appropriate department, unit, or program head, or director or \\ndesignated committee \\n• Formal written appeal to the Dean  \\n• Formal written appeal to the Provost  \\n• Provost issues final non-appealable decision \\nTaxation of Graduate Student Awards Policy \\nI. Statement \\nGraduate student awards given by the university may be subject to U.S. federal, state and \\nlocal income (wage) taxes and required withholdings. This Policy explains the U.S. federal, \\nstate and local income (wage) taxation and withholding for graduate student awards given \\nby the university. II. U.S. Federal Personal Income Tax (and Tax Status) \\na. U.S. Citizens and Permanent Residents \\nTo fulfill its legal obligations, the university treats graduate student awards by the \\nuniversity in the form of scholarships, fellowships, teaching assistantships, research \\nassistantships and stipends as being subject to U.S. federal personal income tax as \\nfollows: \\n\", '105 \\n \\n \\n• If a graduate student is not a degree candidate, all award funds are subject to tax. • If a graduate student is a degree candidate, the amount of any award used for tuition, \\nfees and required books, supplies and equipment is not subject to tax. The amount \\nused for other expenses such as room, board and travel is subject to tax. • If a graduate student incurs business and/or travel expenses on the university’s behalf \\nand submits the expense reimbursement in compliance with the university’s Business \\nand Travel Expense (BTE) Policy, these expenses are not subject to tax. • The part of any award that represents payment for the student\\'s services such as \\nteaching, research or other service (e.g., writing, administrative assistance, etc.) is \\nsubject to tax. In computing graduate student taxable income for purposes of required tax withholdings \\nand any required informational returns, the university can determine centrally the part of \\na graduate student\\'s award that covers tuition and required university fees, since the \\nuniversity publishes these costs. If departments submit to the HR Service Center a \\nmonthly award amount in addition to tuition and required fees, the entire additional \\namount is subject to tax. It is the graduate students’ responsibility to determine the \\nportion of their award used for any additional required fees and expenses (e.g., books, \\nsupplies and equipment). The university excludes the amount of the graduate student\\'s award used for tuition and \\nrequired university fees from the amount of taxable income shown on the graduate \\nstudent’s IRS Form W-2. Graduate students who have questions about the U.S. federal personal income tax \\nconsequences of their graduate student awards should consult their own personal tax \\nadvisor or refer to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 970, \"Tax Benefits for \\nEducation.\" Non-resident alien graduate students may also wish to review the “Students \\nand Apprentices” section of IRS Publication 901, \"U.S. Tax Treaties.\" These IRS \\npublications, and more information about U.S. federal income taxes, may be found at \\nwww.irs.gov. b. Foreign Students and Permanent Residents \\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. citizens and permanent residents are \\nconsidered residents, but foreign graduate students may be considered residents or non-\\nresidents for tax purposes. Information on tax residency status may be found in IRS \\nPublication 519, “U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens.” Some foreign graduate students may benefit \\nfrom specific tax treaties between the U.S. and their home countries. Information on tax \\n', '106 \\n \\n \\ntreaties is contained in IRS Publication 901, “U.S. Tax Treaties.” These IRS publications, and \\nmore information on U.S. federal income taxes, may be found at www.irs.gov. III. Pennsylvania Personal Income Tax \\nThe following applies only for those graduate students providing services within \\nPennsylvania. Therefore, if the graduate student is providing services at a university \\nlocation in another state as part of the degree requirements that state’s income tax may \\nbe withheld from fellowship or stipend payments. For purposes of Pennsylvania personal income tax and required withholdings, to fulfill its \\nlegal obligations, the university treats fellowship awards and stipends as taxable \\ncompensation for services if the recipient is required to apply his skill and training to \\nadvance research, creative work, or some other project or activity, unless the recipient is a \\ncandidate for a degree and the same activities are required of all candidates for that \\ndegree as a condition to receiving the degree. Thus, as long as the services rendered by a \\ngraduate student are a standard part of the degree requirements for all students in the \\nstudent’s program, the university will not withhold Pennsylvania personal income tax from \\nthe student’s award/stipend. At the university, when graduate students are required to \\nrender services, those services are generally required to be rendered as a standard part \\nof the degree requirements for the relevant degree program; as long as departments \\nconfirm that the services are required to be rendered as a standard part of the degree \\nprogram, the university will not withhold Pennsylvania personal income tax from \\nfellowship awards or stipends for students performing those services. Further information about Pennsylvania personal income taxes may be obtained by \\nvisiting the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue website. IV. City of Pittsburgh/Pittsburgh Public School District Earned Income Tax (Wage \\nTax) \\nThe following applies only for those graduate students providing services within \\nPennsylvania. Therefore, if the graduate student is providing services at a university \\nlocation in another state as part of the degree requirements that state’s income tax may \\nbe withheld from fellowship or stipend payments. To fulfill its legal obligations, the university treats compensation that is subject to the \\nPennsylvania personal income tax (and required Pennsylvania personal income tax \\nwithholdings) as compensation that is subject to the City of Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh \\nPublic School District’s local earned income (wage) tax (EIT). Therefore, if an award is not \\nconsidered by the university to be compensation for purposes of the Pennsylvania \\n', \"107 \\n \\n \\npersonal income tax, it is not considered compensation for the EIT. As a result, the \\nuniversity does not withhold EIT from graduate students for fellowship awards and \\nstipends that are not subject to Pennsylvania personal income tax withholding. Further information about the City of Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh Public School District EIT \\nmay be obtained by visiting the City of Pittsburgh's Department of Finance website. V. Assistance in Responding to Correspondence from Taxing Bodies \\nShould a graduate student receive correspondence from the Pennsylvania Department of \\nRevenue and/or the City of Pittsburgh (on behalf of itself and the Pittsburgh Public School \\nDistrict) erroneously seeking to tax some or all of a fellowship award or stipend that was \\npaid to the student for services rendered in Pennsylvania, and required to be rendered as \\na standard part of the degree requirements for the student’s degree program, the \\ngraduate student's department should contact the HR Service Center to obtain a letter to \\ncomplete on behalf of the graduate student citing the relevant Pennsylvania or EIT, as \\napplicable, exclusion from tax. If requested, the HR Service Center will provide the tax year and income paid to the \\ndepartment, and the remaining information will be completed by the department before \\nproviding it to the graduate student. The letter should be sent by the graduate student to \\nthe Pennsylvania Department of Revenue and/or the City of Pittsburgh, as the case may \\nbe. Temporary Emergency Closing of the University Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nCarnegie Mellon University has an important commitment to students, employees, \\nparents, sponsors, benefactors and the community. Accordingly, the university will make \\nevery attempt to operate normally during severe weather or other emergencies. This \\nincludes holding classes, conducting research programs, and operating facilities and \\nservices. The university will attempt to operate normally unless such operation represents \\na clear threat to the health and safety of students, staff, faculty and visitors. In the event of severe weather or other emergencies, the Emergency Preparedness and \\nResponse Team will assess the situation and provide recommendations to university \\nleadership as to whether the university can continue normal operations, if normal \\noperations including in-person classes, meetings, events and student activities should be \\nconducted remotely, or if normal operations should be suspended. In the event it is \\ndecided that all normal operations on campus need to be conducted remotely or \\n\", '108 \\n \\n \\nsuspended, only the president (or the president\\'s designated representative) has the \\nauthority to modify operations and/or close the university and to specify those persons or \\ngroup of persons who are to refrain from coming to the Pittsburgh campus and/or who \\nare free to leave work or class early. Staff members who provide essential services, such \\nas certain members of Campus Operations (including Emergency Management, Facilities \\nManagement and Campus Services, Computing Services and University Police) and \\nStudent Affairs (including Dining Services, Housing Services, etc.) may be required to work. Standard Operations \\nUnless the president announces the university is closed or government authorities \\nrequire a closure, CMU faculty and staff are expected to carry out their work \\nresponsibilities. When the university is in session, faculty members are expected to meet \\ntheir scheduled classes and other obligations. If a faculty member is unable to meet a \\nscheduled class, they should notify their department head or supervisor and arrange for \\neither a qualified substitute or some other manner to make up the course session and/or \\ncoverage of the necessary course material. If the university is open but an essential staff member is unable to come to campus \\nbecause of severe weather or other emergency, they should notify their supervisor as \\nsoon as possible to make alternative work arrangements. Announcement of Closing \\nAs soon as the president or the designee determines that university operations must be \\nmodified or closed due to an emergency, announcements will be issued via Carnegie \\nMellon email and the university’s emergency alert system, as well as posted to the CMU \\nhomepage and the CMU Alert website. Media Relations staff may also inform local media \\norganizations. Transfer Credit Evaluation and Assignment Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nThe Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses, originally dated January 13, 1993, and \\napproved by the Committee on Educational Programs and Student and Faculty Affairs \\nstates: \\n\"Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit \\nthrough a cross-registration program and through the receipt of transfer credit from \\n', \"109 \\n \\n \\nother accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include \\ninformation on such courses as follows: \\nCarnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross-registration \\nprogram will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All \\nother courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, \\nbut without grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, \\nhonors or QPA calculations.” (Note: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; \\nhowever, they may receive transfer credit only if their college's and department's policies allow \\nthis.) \\nDefinitions \\nA Carnegie Mellon course is one conducted under Carnegie Mellon University regulations \\nregarding course content and grading and taught by faculty under the supervision of a \\nCarnegie Mellon academic unit. Courses taught by Carnegie Mellon faculty at a Carnegie \\nMellon campus and/or teaching location qualify. Courses that are part of the regular offerings of other universities do not qualify, unless \\nfaculty at the other universities receive appointments at Carnegie Mellon and handle \\nCarnegie Mellon students under Carnegie Mellon academic regulations. Courses offered for cross-registration are those taken under the PCHE (Pittsburgh Council \\non Higher Education) agreement or under the Qatar Education City agreement. Only official and final college or university transcripts will be accepted for the awarding of \\ntransfer credit. Grade reports, letters and the like are not acceptable. It is the \\nresponsibility of the Office of Undergraduate Admission, graduate admissions committees \\nor the University Registrar's Office to verify official transcripts. Official transcripts for the \\nawarding of transfer credit will reside in the student's permanent university academic \\nrecord in the University Registrar's Office. It is the responsibility of each academic department to review and establish transfer \\ncourse credit for their degree-seeking students. Transfer Credit Evaluation Procedure \\nIncoming Undergraduate First-Year and Transfer Students \\nExternal applicants applying for transfer to Carnegie Mellon will arrange for submission \\nof: \\n• official transcripts to the Office of Undergraduate Admission as part of the admission \\nprocess, \\n\", \"110 \\n \\n \\n• official, final transcripts to the Office of Undergraduate Admission once they are \\nadmitted and prior to their beginning coursework at Carnegie Mellon. As part of the admission process, Admission will verify the official final transcripts, and \\nthen send them to the appropriate academic unit responsible for college/department \\nacceptance decisions. Each unit will be responsible for student's review of transfer credit \\nand the establishment of transfer course credit for each individual student. Current Students \\nCurrent Carnegie Mellon students taking courses at other accredited institutions (colleges \\nand universities), during either summer semesters or as part of exchange programs or \\nother departmentally approved programs, or while on leave from Carnegie Mellon, must \\narrange for the submission of official final transcripts to the University Registrar's Office. Upon receipt, the University Registrar's Office will verify these official transcripts and send \\na copy of the transcript to the appropriate academic unit responsible for that student's \\ncollege/department transfer credit decisions. The official transcript will reside in the \\nstudent's university academic folder in the University Registrar's Office. Each unit will be \\nresponsible for its students' transfer credit review and the establishment of transfer \\ncourse credit for each individual student. Should a unit receive the official transcript, it \\nmust be sent immediately to the University Registrar's Office. Incoming Graduate Students \\nExternal applicants applying for admission to Carnegie Mellon will arrange for submission \\nof: \\n• official transcripts to their graduate admission committee as part of the admission \\nprocess,  \\n• official, final transcripts to their graduate admission committee once they are admitted \\nand prior to their beginning coursework at Carnegie Mellon. As part of the admission process, the graduate admission committee will verify the official \\nfinal transcripts and retain these official documents as part of students' academic record. Each unit will be responsible for students' review of transfer credit and the establishment \\nof transfer course credit for each individual student. \", '111 \\n \\n \\nTuition and Fees Adjustment Policy \\nApplication \\nThis policy applies to withdrawals and leaves of absence by all students (graduate, \\nundergraduate, non-degree) for all semesters (Fall, Spring, Summer 1, Summer 2, Summer \\nAll). Official Date of Withdrawal/Leave of Absence \\nFor students who notify the University of their intent to withdraw or take a leave of \\nabsence, the official date of withdrawal or leave of absence is the earliest of: \\n• the date the student began the withdrawal or leave of absence process; \\n• the date the student notified his or her home department; \\n• the date the student notified the associate dean of his or her college; or \\n• the date the student notified the dean of students. For students who do not notify the University of their intent to withdraw or take a leave of \\nabsence, the official date of withdrawal or leave of absence is: \\n• the midpoint of the semester; or \\n• the last date the student attended an academically-related activity such as an exam, \\ntutorial or study group, or the last day a student turned in a class assignment. Tuition Adjustment \\nStudents who withdraw or take a leave of absence before completing 60% of the semester \\nwill be charged tuition based on the number of days completed within the semester. This \\nincludes calendar days, class and non-class days, from the first day of classes to the last \\nday of final exams. Breaks which last five days or longer, including the preceding and \\nsubsequent weekends, are not counted. Thanksgiving and Spring Break are not counted. There is no tuition adjustment after 60% of the semester is completed. The tuition adjustment schedule is available on The HUB website. No tuition is charged to \\na student who is administratively withdrawn. No tuition is charged to a student who is administratively withdrawn. ', \"112 \\n \\n \\nHousing, Meal Plan & Fee Adjustments \\nHousing charges are adjusted daily, beginning on check-in day and ending on the last day \\nof final exams for the semester. Holiday breaks are included. The Winter Break period is \\nnot included. Meal plan charges are adjusted weekly. Dine Express and Campus Express are assessed \\nbased upon actual use. There is no adjustment of the PAT bus fee or Student Activity fee. Financial Aid Adjustment \\nFederal and institutional financial aid is adjusted on the same basis as tuition. A student \\nearns 100% of his or her federal or institutional financial aid when 60% of the semester is \\ncompleted. Student grants and non-federal outside scholarships are adjusted based upon the \\nwithdrawal policy of the agency awarding the funds. Undergraduate Course Meeting Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nNo undergraduate classes, exams, academic, or artistic activities (including: extra help \\nsession, rehearsals, ROTC drill, make-up exams, etc.) are scheduled on weekdays between \\n4:50 p.m. and 6:50 p.m. Extra class time beyond those regularly scheduled must take \\nplace either before 4:50 p.m. or after 6:50 p.m. Undergraduate Course Meeting Procedure \\nThis policy is not intended to reduce the rigor or vigor of the academic or artistic \\nprograms, but to ensure that students have a period in which they are free to carry on co-\\ncurricular activities and athletics. Scheduling classes, exams, or other academic and \\nartistic activities makes it very difficult for the students to meet these commitments. Since \\nwe are all concerned about the quality of life at the university, this time must be held for \\nthe students. In planning the academic course schedule, the University Registrar's Office will review all \\ncourses to ensure that no academic or artistic courses be scheduled in this period. In \\naddition, any requests to schedule additional or makeup course meetings, review and/or \\nstudy sessions, teaching assistant office hours, or other course-related meetings, must \\ntake place either before 4:50 p.m. or after 6:50 p.m. This includes meetings in all \\nuniversity spaces, not just within University Registrar's Office-controlled classrooms. \", '113 \\n \\n \\nAs with any policy, there must be a means of making exceptions. Any academic or artistic \\nactivities which you feel must be scheduled between 4:50 p.m. and 6:50 p.m. must be \\ncleared with the University Registrar. These requests must be in writing either as a memo \\nor through email to CMURegistrar@andrew.cmu.edu. All requests must include the course \\nrelationship, intent for the requested meeting, and the reason why the meeting cannot be \\nheld either before 4:50 p.m. or after 6:50 p.m. Any further clarification of this policy can be addressed to the Associate Vice President \\nand Director of Enrollment Services. Withdrawal of a Degree Policy \\nThe university reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted \\nshould there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in \\nsupport of it had been falsified. In such a case the degree will be withdrawn promptly upon \\ndiscovery of the falsification.

Statute of Limitations \\nThere is no statute of limitations that precludes course instructors from acting on the discovery \\nof alleged violations either during the semester of enrollment in the course in question or after \\nthe course has concluded including after the student(s) has graduated. Important Definitions \\n• Academic Advisor: The individual designated in SIO/S3 as the primary major academic \\nadvisor. The Academic Advisor may be designated by the department to disseminate relevant \\ncorrespondence related to academic disciplinary action within the department according to \\ndepartmental procedure. • Academic Disciplinary Action: Academic disciplinary actions are outcomes imposed for \\nviolations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity including cheating, plagiarism, and \\nunauthorized assistance. • Academic Integrity Liaison: Each department designates an individual who is trained by the \\nOffice of Community Standards and Integrity to provide guidance to course instructors in \\ncases of alleged violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. Absent a \\ndepartmental designation, the associate dean of the college in which the course is housed is \\nthe default liaison for consultation purposes. • Course Failure: A grade of “R” as outlined in the University Policy on Grading. • Course Instructor: Any person responsible for the instruction or grading of a course at the \\nuniversity as documented in the Schedule of Classes. • Department Head: The university faculty or staff member who leads an academic \\ndepartment. In academic disciplinary cases in which the home department is an academic \\nprogram, the program director is considered to be the department head. • Email: The official Carnegie Mellon University email address designated in the university \\ndirectory. ', '117 \\n \\n \\n• Moderator: The Student Affairs staff member who facilitates an Academic Review Board \\nhearing. Moderators are appointed and trained by the Office of Community Standards and \\nIntegrity. The hearing runs at their discretion according to process guidelines. • Process Advisor: As a staff member in the Office of Community Standards and Integrity, the \\nProcess Advisor is responsible for the logistics of convening an Academic Review Board. The \\nProcess Advisor schedules the hearing, assembles the hearing board, informs the involved \\nparties of the procedures for the hearing, and manages other administrative tasks. • Student: Any person registered for, enrolled in, or auditing any course(s) at Carnegie Mellon \\nUniversity at the time of the alleged violation. An individual is also considered to be a student \\nif they have been accepted for admission to the university but are not currently matriculating. Examples include, but are not limited to, students who are enrolled but not taking classes \\ndue to an academic break, medical leave, suspension, or other personal leave; students who \\nwere enrolled at the time of the incident; persons who demonstrate an intent to enroll by \\nregistering for courses; and students participating in study abroad programs. Because there \\nis no statute of limitations for academic integrity violations and proceedings can be \\ncommenced after a student has left the university or graduated, “student” also includes \\nformer students. • Student’s Home College: The college designated in SIO/S3 as the student’s department of \\nenrollment. • Student’s Home Department: The department designated in SIO/S3 as the student’s \\ndepartment of enrollment. • Support Person: A person of the student’s choosing who accompanies the student during the \\nAcademic Review Board hearing. The support person does not participate in the proceedings \\nbut may advise the student and/or be present at a hearing. Registered support persons are \\nnot permitted to participate as witnesses in the same proceedings. Course-Level Review, Decision, and Action \\nIncidents of alleged violations of the University’s Policy on Academic Integrity will be initially \\nreviewed and adjudicated at the course level or the equivalent academic level for projects that \\ninvolve research or creative inquiry. Investigations may be managed by the course instructor(s) \\nor departmental designee. In all cases involving alleged violations of the University Policy on \\nAcademic Integrity, the following procedures apply: \\n', '118 \\n \\n \\nGathering Information \\n1. Suspected violations should be investigated within a reasonable timeframe, ideally \\nwithin one to two weeks of discovering the alleged violation. 2. Instructors should notify the involved student(s) of the alleged violation(s) and provide \\nthe student(s) the opportunity to respond in an in person meeting or by phone or \\nvideoconference as circumstances warrant. 3. Course instructors may receive information from other individuals (e.g., students, staff, \\nfaculty) who possess direct information related to the alleged violation(s) under review. For example, someone may have observed the suspected incident or interacted directly \\nwith the involved student(s) before, during, or after the incident in question. 4. When discussing alleged violations with the involved student(s) or witnesses, instructors \\nshould avoid revealing the identity of other involved parties unless it is necessary in \\norder to determine responsibility. 5. If a student does not respond to notification of an alleged violation(s) of the University \\nPolicy on Academic Integrity, the matter may be reviewed in their absence by the course \\ninstructor after a reasonable period of time. In these circumstances, the course \\ninstructor may proceed with determination of responsibility and outcome. Determining Responsibility and Course-Level Action \\n1. The course instructor will decide whether the suspected violation(s) occurred based on \\navailable evidence. At this stage, instructors are encouraged to consult with the \\ndepartment’s designated Academic Integrity Liaison, department/program head, the \\ncollege dean’s office or the Office of Community Standards and Integrity regarding the \\nnature of the suspected violation(s), the nature of the evidence related to the alleged \\nviolation(s), and the range of outcomes under consideration. 2. When assessing responsibility for an academic integrity violation, the course instructor \\nshould apply a preponderance of the evidence standard. A preponderance of the \\nevidence means that the course instructor has determined that it is more likely than not \\nthat the student has violated the University Policy on Academic Integrity. 3. If the course instructor concludes that the student is responsible for the alleged \\nviolation(s), the course instructor should determine an outcome. The most severe \\noutcome that can be assessed at this level of review and action is course failure \\n', \"119 \\n \\n \\nalthough the instructors and/or department heads may recommend additional \\noutcomes for consideration during second-level review, decision, and action. 4. Students who have pending or documented academic disciplinary action may not drop \\nor withdraw from the course in question. In rare circumstances, the course instructor \\nmay provide explicit approval to drop the course. Students who drop the course without \\nthe proper permission will be manually re-enrolled in the course and further outcomes \\nmay result. 5. Students who have pending or documented academic disciplinary action may not \\nchange a course to P/NP (including the use of a voucher) \\nDocumenting and Reporting the Course-Level Decision \\n1. After determining responsibility and outcomes for a violation(s), the instructor should \\nimmediately and in writing via email notify the involved student(s) of the decision. If \\nfound responsible, the rationale for the determination of responsibility should be \\nincluded in that notification. The outcome(s) that the course instructor has assessed \\nshould be noted as well. Students should also be informed of the opportunity to request \\nan appeal and the procedures for doing so. 2. All documented violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity should be \\nreported to the Office of Community Standards and Integrity upon completion of the \\ninvestigation and student notification. Reports may be submitted using the Academic \\nIntegrity Reporting Form. 3. A copy of the email communication to the student should be included with the report. Course instructors are also encouraged to submit all evidence and supporting \\ndocumentation. 4. Upon receipt of the violation report, the Office of Community Standards and Integrity \\nwill notify the following individuals of the course-level decision and action: \\n• Head of the student’s home department \\n• Associate dean of the student’s home college  \\n• Academic advisor for the student \\n• Head of department in which the course is registered (if different from the student's \\ndepartment) \\n\", \"120 \\n \\n \\n• Associate dean of the college in which the course is registered (if different from the \\nstudent's college) \\n5. Students will receive official notification that the report has been received from the \\nOffice of Community Standards and Integrity. The notification will include an invitation \\nto meet with a process advisor in the Office of Community Standards to discuss the \\ncase, review the appeal process, and prepare for second-level review (if needed). 6. In addition to the above notifications, the Office of Community Standards and Integrity \\nwill be responsible for coordinating all second-level review, decision, and action and \\ndocumenting the violation in the student’s university conduct record consistent with the \\nuniversity policy on Student Conduct Records Retention and Reporting. Appeals of Course-Level Action \\nWhen a student has received official notification of course-level action from the Office of \\nCommunity Standards and Integrity, a student has seven calendar days to request an appeal of \\ncourse-level action. All requests for appeal must be submitted in writing via email to the Office of \\nCommunity Standards and Integrity. The written appeal request must indicate whether the student is appealing the finding of \\nresponsibility, the outcome, or both, as well as the basis for the appeal itself. The basis of an \\nappeal will be limited to one or more of the following: \\n• A gross error in procedural process that materially affected the outcome; \\n• Inconsistency between the available evidence and the finding(s) of responsibility in the \\ncourse-level review; \\n• Stated course-level outcome(s) of failure in the course(s) that was not commensurate with \\nthe violation(s) of the University Policy on Academic Integrity for which the student was found \\nresponsible; and \\n• New information, which was not reasonably available at the time of the course-level review, \\nmerits re-consideration of the final disposition. The vice president for student affairs or designee will review the written appeal request and \\ndetermine whether, in their judgment, the appeal presents an appealable issue that warrants \\nreview by an Academic Review Board. In the event of an appeal, outcomes will normally be held in abeyance pending the outcome of \\nthe appeal. \", '121 \\n \\n \\nShould the vice president for student affairs or designee determine that sufficient grounds exist \\nfor further review, the Academic Review Board will adjudicate the appeal in a hearing with the \\nparticipation of the course instructor(s) or designee and the involved student, both of whom are \\nrequired to participate in the proceedings. The purpose of the hearing will be to make a \\nrecommendation to the vice provost for education or designee as to whether the course \\ninstructor’s initial decision should be upheld, vacated or modified based on a preponderance of \\nthe evidence standard. A preponderance of the evidence means that it is more likely than not \\nthat student violated the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The course instructor(s) will be asked to provide all documentation related to the case if not \\nalready submitted, including the email to the student documenting the course-level action and \\nsupporting evidence related to the violation, to be considered by the Academic Review Board. Appropriate redaction will be made by the Office of Community Standards and Integrity prior to \\nboard member review. Second-Level Review, Decision, and Action \\nSecond-level review is required in the following circumstances: \\n• Cases in which a student has committed more than one violation of the University Policy on \\nAcademic Integrity that has been reported to the Office of Community Standards and \\nIntegrity. • Cases in which a course instructor/student’s department head or designee requests \\nadditional action beyond course failure. Multiple Violation Reports \\nSecond-level review is required in all cases in which a student has committed more than one \\nviolation of the University Policy on Academic Integrity that has been reported to the Office of \\nCommunity Standards and Integrity. When more than one violation has been reported about a student, the Office of Community \\nStandards and Integrity should notify the head of the student’s home department. The \\nstudent’s department head or designee may recommend appropriate outcomes given \\nmultiple violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity and document that \\nrecommendation in writing via email to the student and the Office of Community Standards \\nand Integrity. The departmental recommendation will then be reviewed by an Academic \\nReview Board in a hearing. ', '122 \\n \\n \\nIf the student’s department head or designee declines to recommend an outcome, members \\nof the Academic Review Board will recommend an outcome as part of their review in a \\nhearing. If the student’s department head or designee declines to recommend an outcome, \\nthe student’s department head or designee should document that decision in writing via \\nemail to the student. The Academic Review Board will review the departmental recommendation (if advanced) in a \\nhearing in which the involved student will be given the opportunity to participate. The \\nstudent’s department head or designee and course instructors will also be given the \\nopportunity to participate in the full review. If they opt not to attend the full hearing, they \\nshould be available to participate in the hearing as witnesses. The purpose of the hearing will \\nbe to determine whether additional university action beyond the course-level outcomes is \\nwarranted given multiple violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. In order for the Academic Review Board to determine an appropriate outcome, the student’s \\ndepartment head or designee and course instructors will be asked to provide all \\ndocumentation related to the case if not already submitted, including the email to the \\nstudent documenting the course-level actions and supporting evidence related to the \\nviolations, to be considered by the Academic Review Board. Appropriate redaction will be \\nmade by the Office of Community Standards and Integrity prior to board member review. Requests for Additional Outcomes \\nSecond-level review is required in all cases in which a course instructor or a student’s home \\ndepartment requests additional action beyond course failure. In these circumstances, the course instructor/student’s department head or designee should \\nnotify the student in writing via email that additional outcomes are being requested given the \\nseverity of the policy violation. This notification may occur in the initial course-level action \\nnotification or in a subsequent communication. The Academic Review Board will adjudicate the request for additional outcomes in a hearing \\nin which both the party who is requesting the action and the involved student will be given \\nthe opportunity to participate. The purpose of the hearing will be to determine whether \\nadditional university action beyond course failure is warranted given the nature of the policy \\nviolation. In order for the Academic Review Board to determine an appropriate outcome, the course \\ninstructor will be asked to provide all documentation related to the case if not already \\nsubmitted, including the email to the student documenting the course-level action and \\nsupporting evidence related to the violation, to be considered by the Academic Review Board. ', '123 \\n \\n \\nAppropriate redaction will be made by the Office of Community Standards and Integrity prior \\nto board member review. Academic Review Board \\nThe Academic Review Board has jurisdiction in the following cases: \\n• Appeals of a course instructor’s course-level decision and action. • Cases in which a student has committed more than one violation of the University Policy on \\nAcademic Integrity that has been reported to the Office of Community Standards and \\nIntegrity. • Cases in which a course instructor/student’s department head or designee requests \\nadditional action beyond course failure. Composition of the Academic Review Board \\nEach case presented to the Academic Review Board is heard by two student board members \\nand three faculty board members. The board for any case must include at least one member \\nfrom the college(s) represented by the parties. When possible, the board for any case must \\ninclude at least one student member at the same degree level as the student who is \\nappearing before the board. In addition, a trained moderator presides over the hearing. The faculty board members will be appointed by the Office of Community Standards and \\nIntegrity in consultation with Faculty Senate. The student board members will be appointed \\nby the Office of Community Standards and Integrity in consultation with Undergraduate \\nStudent Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly following a selection process \\ncoordinated by the Office of Community Standards and Integrity. All appointees must \\ncomplete initial and ongoing training in order to be eligible to serve as board members. Once \\ntrained, board members may complete up to three years of service, and board members \\nmay be reappointed. Members participating in a given hearing will be selected from a list of eligible individuals \\nbased upon availability and disinterestedness in the case or parties following review by the \\nstudent who is appearing before the Academic Review Board. The involved course \\ninstructor(s), department head or designee, and board members will also have the \\nopportunity to note any potential conflicts of interest. The following circumstances would \\npreclude participation as a board member in a given hearing: \\n', '124 \\n \\n \\n• Individuals with prior substantial knowledge of or interest in the student(s) involved or the \\ncase(s) under review \\n• Individuals who may appropriately be a witness in the case(s) \\nConduct of the Academic Review Board \\nThe university attempts to ensure fair, timely and orderly procedures in all academic \\ndisciplinary actions. To provide for this, the university has adopted the following procedural \\nprotections. The following is a list of procedures that govern the Academic Review Board \\nprocess: \\nHearing Preparation and Scheduling \\n1. In advance of the hearing, the members of the Academic Review Board will be \\nprovided a pre-read packet, which may include, among other relevant items: the \\ninitial academic integrity violation report(s); any supporting documentation related to \\nthe violation(s); any departmental recommendations for outcomes (if applicable); and \\na written introduction from the student to the board. 2. The student may submit a written introduction and up to three written letters of \\nsupport by a date specified by the process advisor. Additional information that is \\nrelevant to the review including email correspondence and assignment \\ndocumentation may be submitted by the student. This documentation will be \\nincluded in the pre-read packet at the discretion of the process advisor. 3. It is the responsibility of the Office of Community Standards and Integrity to ensure \\nthat times set for hearings are reasonable and that necessary accommodations have \\nbeen offered to both the student and course instructor(s) whenever appropriate. In \\nturn, both the student and course instructors(s) will be expected to demonstrate \\ngood-faith efforts in their participation with this process, particularly in relation to the \\nscheduling of the hearing. If a case involves exigent circumstances that prevent the \\nstudent or course instructor(s) from participating in a scheduled hearing, the hearing \\nwill be rescheduled. 4. Every effort will be made to avoid conflicts with a student’s class schedule when \\nidentifying a hearing date and time. When circumstances warrant, classroom \\nattendance, except for scheduled examinations, will not be a reasonable excuse for \\ndelaying a hearing. ', '125 \\n \\n \\nHearing Process and Procedures \\n1. Information provided during an Academic Review Board hearing must be kept \\nconfidential by all parties. The student is provided a full copy of all materials provided \\nto the hearing board for the purpose of preparing for or use during the hearing, \\nconsistent with the privacy rights of those involved. These materials are to be kept \\nconfidential and may be shared only with permission from the process advisor. These documents may not be duplicated nor utilized for any other purpose. All \\nmaterials provided to the student must be returned to the process advisor at the \\nconclusion of the hearing. 2. In order to maintain a fair and equitable process, no new materials will be accepted \\non the day of the hearing, with the exception of (i) oral testimony and (ii) such other \\nevidence as may be necessary to rebut new oral testimony. Evidence offered as \\nrebuttal will be accepted only at the discretion of the moderator. 3. Prior to the hearing, the student, course instructor(s), department head or designee \\nwho are participating in the review will be asked if they believe that the potential \\nhearing board members are biased for or against them. If a perceived bias is \\nreasonable, replacements will be chosen for the board and the hearing will be \\nrescheduled. 4. The student has the right to have one person of their choosing present at the \\nhearing. The student is required to notify the process advisor of their support person \\nof choice at a date specified by the process advisor which will be at least three days \\nin advance. If legal counsel will serve in this capacity, the hearing group may \\ndetermine that it wishes to secure legal advice in connection with the hearing. Legal \\ncounsel or any other support person, if present, will not be permitted to participate \\nin the proceedings but may advise the student and/or be present at a hearing. In the \\nevent that one party to a case is accompanied by legal counsel without advance \\nnotice, a hearing may be postponed until all parties to the case have had an \\nopportunity to have counsel present. Registered support persons are not permitted \\nto participate as witnesses in the same proceedings. 5. Witnesses may be registered for each Academic Review Board hearing by the \\nstudent, course instructor(s), and department head. Witnesses should be able to \\nprovide direct information related to the case(s) under review by the Academic \\nReview Board, such as direct observation of the incident(s) in question and/or direct \\ninteraction with any of the parties before, during or after the incident in question. All \\n', \"126 \\n \\n \\nparties are required to notify the process advisor of their registered witnesses at a \\ndate specified by the process advisor which will be at least three days in advance of \\nthe Academic Review Board hearing.. 6. In scheduling a hearing, consideration should be given to allow that witnesses \\nsignificant to the case being heard are available to the hearing group. If a witness is \\nnot available to be called by the hearing group in person or via telecommunication, \\nthey may submit a written statement to the process advisor to be reviewed if the \\nboard requests information from the witness. Except in documented extenuating \\ncircumstances, students are expected to make a good-faith effort to provide \\ninformation to the Academic Review Board when called as a witness. 7. It is within the discretion of the board to determine whether they wish to hear from \\nsuggested witnesses. Witnesses will be questioned one at a time by the hearing \\ngroup and subsequently dismissed. They should be present in the room only when \\nproviding information to the board. 8. All proceedings, except the deliberation of the board members, will be recorded. Recordings will be kept in accordance with student conduct records retention \\npractices. 9. During the actual hearing, the student has the right to be present during \\npresentation of evidence. 10. Students and course instructors who are participating in a hearing will be limited to \\nten minutes for their introduction and five minutes to provide a summary following \\nthe presentation of evidence. 11. The majority of the proceeding will consist of questioning from the board members \\nfor all parties as well as registered witnesses. Students and course instructors will \\nalso have the opportunity to present questions for the board’s consideration. 12. Following each summary, the board will enter closed deliberations. 13. In cases that involve appeals of course-level action, no information about the \\nstudent's prior violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity will be shared \\nwith the Academic Review Board. If the student has prior violations on record and \\nthe course-level action is upheld on appeal, the student may be recalled before the \\nboard to discuss the prior violations and outcomes prior to the Academic Review \\nBoard making a recommendation for appropriate outcomes for the present case. \", \"127 \\n \\n \\nHearing Outcome Determination and Notifications \\n1. A representative of the Office of Community Standards and Integrity will be \\nresponsible for notifying the vice provost for education or designee in writing of the \\nrecommendation of the hearing group. 2. The vice provost for education or designee makes the decision in the case, informed \\nby the recommendation of the Academic Review Board. The vice provost for \\neducation or designee may accept, reject or modify the recommendation, or may \\nremand the matter to a new Academic Review Board for review. 3. After reviewing the recommendations and rendering a decision, the vice provost for \\neducation or designee will notify the student in writing of their decision. 4. The Office of Community Standards and Integrity will send a copy of the final \\ndecision letter to the following individuals: \\n• Course instructor(s) \\n• Head of the student's home department \\n• Associate dean of the student's home college  \\n• Academic advisor for the student \\n• Head of department in which the course(s) is housed (if different from the \\nstudent's department) \\n• Associate dean of the college in which the course(s) is housed (if different from \\nthe student's college) \\n5. Parents of a student will not be notified of any academic disciplinary action, except as \\npermitted by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). 6. Academic disciplinary actions will be recorded in the student's disciplinary record in \\nthe Office of Community Standards and Integrity in accordance with student conduct \\nrecords retention practices. When academic disciplinary actions affect eligibility for \\nenrollment, designation on other university records will be made. Academic \\ndisciplinary records will not be released as a part of the official transcript of the \\nacademic record of a student. \", '128 \\n \\n \\nAppeals of Academic Review Board Decisions \\nA student may appeal a decision delivered by the vice provost for education or designee \\nfollowing the Academic Review Board process by submitting a request for appeal in writing via \\nemail to the provost of the university  within seven calendar days of the official notification of \\nthe decision. In cases in which the Academic Review Board decision pertains to an appeal of course-level \\naction, the course instructor may submit a request for appeal in writing to the provost of the \\nuniversity within seven calendar days of the official notification of the decision. In cases in which \\nthe Academic Review Board decision pertains to matters that involve multiple violation reports \\nor requests for additional outcomes, the course instructor and/or student’s department head or \\ndesignee may submit a request for appeal in writing to the provost of the university within seven \\ncalendar days of the official notification of the decision. The written appeal request should indicate whether the appeal concerns the finding(s) of \\nresponsibility, the outcome(s), or both, as well as the basis for the appeal itself. The basis of an \\nappeal will be limited to one or more of the following cases: \\n• A gross error in procedural process that materially affected the outcome; \\n• The outcomes imposed during the second-level review were not commensurate with the \\nviolation(s) of the University Policy on Academic Integrity for which the student was found \\nresponsible; \\n• Inconsistency between the available evidence and the finding(s) of responsibility in the \\ncourse-level action appeal review or second-level review; \\n• New information, which was not reasonably available at the time of the hearing, merits re-\\nconsideration of the final disposition. The appeal officer designated by the provost will review the written appeal request and \\ndetermine whether, in the judgment of the appeal officer, the appeal presents an appealable \\nissue that warrants review by the appeal officer. In hearing an appeal, the appeal officer, at their \\ndiscretion, may meet with individuals and review information relevant to the basis of the appeal. In the event of an appeal, outcomes will normally be held in abeyance pending the outcome of \\nthe appeal. Appeals will be decided by the appeal officer in a timely manner as circumstances warrant. While \\nan appeal is under review, the appeal officer will update the student, course instructor, and \\ndepartment head as necessary about the anticipated timeline. ', \"129 \\n \\n \\nThe appeal officer will require that the dean of the student’s college review the case and provide \\ninput on the final disposition. The appeal officer has the authority to accept, vacate or modify the decision as they deem \\nappropriate for resolution of the matter being appealed. The appeal officer may reconvene the \\ninitial Academic Review Board or remand the matter to a new Academic Review Board for \\nreview. Outcomes \\nThe academic disciplinary action outcomes defined below comprise a range of official actions \\nthat may be imposed during second-level review. One or more of these actions may be imposed \\nin response to a given situation. This list is not comprehensive, as other outcomes may be \\nimposed as appropriate. Non-compliance with outcomes may result in further action through the Academic Review Board \\nprocess. The determination of outcomes will be guided by the following considerations: the interests of \\nthe community, the learning and development of the student, the impact of the violation(s), and \\nany mitigating or aggravating circumstances. Outcomes related to student standing \\nThese outcomes clarify the student's standing with the University. Additional violations of the \\nAcademic Integrity policy may result in more severe outcomes including separation from the \\nUniversity. • Disciplinary Probation: A student may be placed on disciplinary probation for a \\ndesignated period of time. Probation may entail specific requirements to be met. When a \\nstudent is on disciplinary probation, they may be subject to suspension or expulsion in \\nthe event of further academic disciplinary action. • Disciplinary Suspension: A student may be barred from enrollment for a designated \\nperiod of time. Students who have been suspended are required to absent themselves \\nfrom the campus (including university housing, fraternity or sorority houses, offices, labs, \\nand libraries) within a maximum of two days after the action and to remain off the \\ncampus for the duration of the time specified as outlined in the University Policy on \\nStudent Suspension/Required Withdrawal. A student on academic disciplinary suspension \\nis not eligible for student employment by the university during the period of suspension. \", '130 \\n \\n \\n• Drop from Academic Program: The student is required to sever entirely their connection \\nwith the academic program in which they are currently enrolled. Students who have been \\ndropped from an academic program may apply for admission to other academic \\nprograms at the university. • Expulsion: The student is required to sever entirely their connection with the university. Students who have been expelled are required to absent themselves from the campus \\n(including university housing, fraternity or sorority houses, offices, labs, and libraries) \\nwithin a maximum of two days after the action and to remain off of the campus \\npermanently, unless otherwise specified. Students who have been expelled from the \\nuniversity may not apply for admission to other academic programs at the university. • Loss of Privilege: Students may lose specified privileges, which may include access to \\nfacilities, services, and/or the opportunity to participate in university activities. Restorative Outcomes \\nThese outcomes require the student to take action to repair the harm their behavior caused \\nor to utilize university resources to support their continued engagement in the community. Failure to complete these outcomes by the specified deadline may result in additional \\nacademic disciplinary action. • Behavioral Assessments and Recommendations: The university may require a student to \\nmeet with a health care provider and/or a mental health care provider within a specified \\ntime frame. If so, the student will be expected to fully participate in any relevant \\nassessment requested by the provider and complete any consequent recommendation(s), \\nsuch as a treatment plan or a referral to another provider. The student is also expected to \\nprovide the appropriate releases to allow the university to confirm compliance with this \\noutcome. • Community Service: The university may require uncompensated service (a specified \\nnumber of hours) to the university or an off-campus, non-profit organization as an \\noutcome. The particular assignment of duties must be pre-approved by the process \\nadvisor. Students must provide appropriate documentation verifying their completed \\ncommunity service. • Educational/Developmental Assignment: The university may require a student to \\ncomplete a project, assignment, or activity to promote the student’s education and \\ndevelopment. These assignments are determined by the Academic Review Board and \\n', '131 \\n \\n \\ncompletion is monitored by the process advisor. Assignments may include but are not \\nlimited to: reflection or research paper, development of a presentation, discussion with an \\nindividual, apology letter, reading assignment, etc. Withholding a Degree \\nBecause a degree from the university signifies not only successful completion of academic \\nrequirements but also compliance with the university’s standards and good standing as a \\nmember of the university community, the dean of students or designee may direct that a degree \\nnot be certified by the university registrar and therefore not awarded pending the resolution of \\nacademic disciplinary action proceedings, including completion of all outcomes. Academic Disciplinary Actions Retention and Reporting \\nRecords of academic disciplinary actions proceedings are confidential and are not released \\nwithout the consent of the current/former student or as otherwise required or authorized by law \\nor court order. With the exceptions as noted below, records of academic disciplinary actions \\nproceedings are retained for three years after final separation of the student from the \\nuniversity. For purposes of determining final separation from the university, a student must be \\nseparated for three continuous years. If a student reenrolls in any student program within three \\nyears, the calculation of the final separation date will reset. Consistent with the Student Privacy Rights Policy, for purposes of academic disciplinary actions \\nrecord checks, information from these records is only provided, with appropriate authorization \\nas necessary, for three years after final separation from the university (as defined above) \\nprovided the student has fulfilled all obligations to the university. The file may be maintained indefinitely and reported longer than three years after the student \\nseparates from the university if a student has not fulfilled all obligations or has not resolved a \\npending Academic Integrity violation. Records of academic disciplinary actions proceedings resulting in the permanent separation of a \\nstudent from the university (e.g., expulsion) will be maintained and reported indefinitely. Case-specific questions regarding timeframes for academic disciplinary actions records \\nretention and reporting can be directed to the Office of Community Standards & Integrity.

Carnegie Mellon are under the direction of \\nStudent Government, the Division of Student Affairs, or particular university departments, \\ncommittees and councils advisory to the officers of the university. In general, students are \\ncharged with exercising a high level of self-governance related to extracurricular activities \\nand, toward that end, are encouraged to form organizations that serve their extracurricular \\nneeds and qualify for recognition and/or funding by Student Government. Financial statements of all organizations or committees that collect money, in any manner, \\nfrom the student body must be available to Student Government if requested. Publication in \\nThe Tartan of a statement of the accounts may be required at the option of Student \\nGovernment. Eligibility \\nExtracurricular activities are any campus social, cultural, service or honorary organization; \\nvarsity, club or intramural athletic team; or any other campus organization recognized by \\nStudent Government or by the university whether participation is on the intercollegiate \\nlevel or within the university. Students who meet the criteria outlined in the Student \\nActivities Fee policy will be assessed the Student Activities Fee by Enrollment Services, and \\nwill be eligible to participate in extracurricular activities upon paying the fee. Enrolled \\nstudents who seek to participate in extracurricular activities but who are not automatically \\nassessed the Student Activities Fee must pay the relevant semester(s) fee prior to \\nparticipation. Active Medical Assistance Protocol (AMAP) \\nThe university community values the health and safety of its members and supports an \\nenvironment that encourages students to come to the assistance of one another. To that \\nend, the active medical assistance protocol (AMAP) sets forth an expectation that community \\nmembers take responsible action when the health or safety of a student is compromised due \\nto overuse or abuse of alcohol or illicit substances and/or as a result of hazing activity. ', \"136 \\n \\n \\nAmnesty from university disciplinary action and University Police action will be granted to the \\nstudent(s) for whom medical assistance is summoned and for those seeking assistance from \\nemergency services personnel[18] when all of the following conditions apply: \\n1. An individual contacted emergency services personnel based on a reasonable belief that \\nanother individual was in need of immediate medical attention, which had not otherwise \\nbeen sought, to prevent death or serious bodily injury; \\n2. The individual seeking assistance provided their own name to the emergency services \\npersonnel; and \\n3. The individual requesting assistance remained with the individual believed to be in need \\nof medical assistance until emergency services personnel arrived and the need for the \\nconcerned individual's presence had ended. Those seeking assistance will be assured that the university will likewise not pursue further \\nuniversity action against any individual or organization involved in such an incident when \\nappropriate medical attention is sought. Students who are directly involved in attending to \\nthe compromised student until help arrives will also be granted amnesty from university \\naction. Students involved in an incident for which amnesty is granted will be provided \\nappropriate educational or developmental interventions. In cases where help is indicated but not sought, the most severe disciplinary action will be \\ntaken against all students involved. This protocol extends the university’s previously established Alcohol Medical Assistance \\nProtocol (1999) and is consistent with the spirit of several Pennsylvania laws that include safe \\nharbor provisions granting immunity from criminal prosecution for seeking medical \\nassistance. Related Pennsylvania Laws: \\nPennsylvania Alcohol Medical Safe Harbor – 18 Pa.C.S. § 6308.1 \\n(a) Immunity for the individual seeking medical attention for another. —  An individual \\nshall not be prosecuted for an offense under section 6308(a) (relating to purchase, \\n \\n18 Emergency services personnel include Carnegie Mellon University Police, CMU Student Emergency Medical Services, and other \\nuniversity staff (i.e. Resident Assistants, Community Advisors and Housefellows) who serve in an emergency response capacity.

', '142 \\n \\n \\nAdvertising on Campus – Graffiti and Poster Policy of Student \\nGovernment \\nIn order to more effectively communicate when events and programs are happening on \\ncampus, the following Student Government Graffiti and Poster Policy was established \\n(revised April 20, 2010). The following is a summary of the policy which can be found in its \\nentirety on the Student Government Policies page. Purpose and Scope of Policy \\nCarnegie Mellon University is a community where many different opportunities are \\navailable outside the classroom. As a result, groups compete for the use of effective \\nadvertising space on campus. The Student Government Graffiti and Poster Policy helps to \\nregulate the use of advertising space on Carnegie Mellon University\\'s Pittsburgh campus. Noting the Use of Student Activities Fees \\nIf one hundred (100) percent of the budget for a student organization, activity or event is \\nfinanced by the Activities Fee, then all advertising and printed material associated with \\nthat organization, activity or event must include the phrase \"Funded by your Student \\nActivities Fee\". If the Activities Fee finances a portion of the budget for a student organization, activity or \\nevent, but less than one hundred (100) percent of that budget, then all advertising and \\nprinted material associated with that organization, activity or event must include either \\nthe phrase \"Funded in part by your Student Activities Fee\", or \"Funded by your Student \\nActivities Fee\". Graffiti \\nGraffiti is not a permissible form of advertising on Carnegie Mellon University\\'s campus. Graffiti is defined as any defacement of Carnegie Mellon University property, the \\ndefacement of posters hung on campus bulletin boards, and/or the use of drawings or \\nmessages in a public space that are libelous in nature or violate the Carnegie Mellon \\nCode. Graffiti is distinguished from painting the fence and chalking on Carnegie Mellon \\nUniversity sidewalks. Permissible forms of advertising on Carnegie Mellon University\\'s \\ncampus include chalking, painting the fence and distributing posters and banners. ', '143 \\n \\n \\nChalking \\nChalking is only permitted on sidewalks. Chalking is not permitted in areas that are not \\ndirectly exposed to rainfall, including covered sidewalks and vertical portions of outdoor \\nstairs. Chalking of this sort is a form of graffiti. The sidewalk chalk used for chalking must \\nbe water-soluble and must be removable by the natural elements. Products such as spray \\nchalk, washable crayons, and other semi-permanent products deemed not removable by \\nthe natural elements are considered a form of graffiti. Painting the Fence \\nPainting the Fence, a long standing tradition at Carnegie Mellon University, is not \\nconsidered graffiti so long as only paintbrushes are used. The use of spray paint, \\nairbrushes, paint rollers, and similar tools to paint the Fence is a form of graffiti. While \\npainting the Fence, all painting materials must be kept within the gravel area surrounding \\nthe Fence. Painting anything other than the Fence is a form of graffiti. Posters \\nCarnegie Mellon University recognized groups, organizations, academic and \\nadministrative departments, and students are only permitted to post active posters on \\nthe Student Government bulletin board. Posters are not permitted on doors, walls, and/or \\nwindows at Carnegie Mellon University. Locations of permitted bulletin boards can be \\nfound on the Student Government website. Posters must meet the following criteria: \\n• The posted items do not exceed a size of 11\" x 17\"; \\n• The name and contact information of the sponsoring Carnegie Mellon University \\nrecognized group, organization, department, or member of the campus community is \\nclearly indicated on the poster, unless that poster has been registered with the Graffiti \\nand Poster Policy Administrator via the Student Senate Campus Life Committee and/or \\nthe Graduate Student Assembly Vice President of Campus Affairs; \\n• There is a maximum of one (1) active poster per event, per bulletin board location; \\n• New posters are not posted over other active posters; \\n• The posted items are removed from bulletin board locations no more than seven (7) \\ndays after they are no longer active posters. Banners \\nStudent organizations are permitted to hang banners on Doherty Hall through the \\nfollowing procedure: \\n', '144 \\n \\n \\n• All banners must be approved by the Office of Student Activities. • Space for large banners that are hung over the entrance to Doherty Hall can be \\nreserved on a first come, first serve basis, through the Office of Student Activities. • Banners posted on the outside wall of Doherty Hall must be removed within forty-eight \\n(48) hours after the event advertised on the banner. If no event is advertised, the \\nbanner must be removed no later than thirty (30) days after its initial posting on \\nDoherty Hall. Enforcement Summary \\nThis policy should be reviewed in its entirety online. The Student Government Graffiti and Poster Policy Administrator will monitor Student \\nGovernment bulletin boards and report any violations and/or graffiti to the appropriate \\nparties. Groups or individuals violating this policy will be notified in writing, noting if a fine \\nis being assessed and the process for appealing that fine. Advertising in the Cohon University Center \\nThose who want their poster to appear on the bulletin board location near the Cohon \\nUniversity Center Information Desk shall submit two posters per event to the Information \\nDesk. This board is maintained by Cohon University Center administration and only \\nposters submitted to the Desk will be displayed; all others will be removed. All other \\nbulletin boards in the Cohon University Center are subject to the regulations set forth by \\nthe Director of the Cohon University Center. Alcohol and Drug Policy \\nI. Policy Statement \\nCarnegie Mellon University is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy community \\nthat supports the academic mission of the institution. In keeping with this commitment, \\nthe university permits the use of alcohol or drugs within its community only in a manner \\nthat is legal, responsible, and consistent with the expectations outlined in this policy. Further, the university makes available information and resources so that its community \\nmembers are positioned to assist anyone whose personal well-being may be negatively \\nimpacted due to misuse of alcohol or drugs. This policy applies to all members of the university community, including all faculty, staff \\nand students. This policy also applies to contractors, volunteers and visitors while on \\n', '145 \\n \\n \\nuniversity property (whether owned or leased) or while being paid or reimbursed with \\nuniversity funds. This policy focuses on compliance with laws in the United States and the \\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania. However, as a global university with operations \\nthroughout the world, Carnegie Mellon is equally committed to compliance with all \\napplicable alcohol and drug laws in all jurisdictions in which the university operates. II. Policy on Illegal Drugs \\nThe unlawful manufacture, possession, distribution, sale, or use of drugs is prohibited at \\nthe university. This prohibition applies to the unlawful possession, distribution, sale, or \\nuse of illegal narcotics, prescription drugs, and other illegal drugs. It is a violation of this \\npolicy for prescription drugs to be provided to or used by someone other than the person \\nfor whom they were prescribed. It is also a violation of this policy for prescription drugs to \\nbe used in a manner for which they were not prescribed. The university complies with all applicable federal, state and local laws. The U.S. federal \\nDrug Free Schools and Communities Act of 1989 requires institutions of higher education \\nthat receive federal funds to comply with U.S. federal drug laws. Although some state and \\nlocal governments have legalized the use of various forms of marijuana, federal law \\ncontinues to prohibit the manufacture, possession, distribution, sale, or use of marijuana. As such, in accordance with U.S. federal law, all forms of marijuana, including prescription \\nmedical marijuana, are prohibited on all university property (whether owned or leased) \\nand in connection with all university programs. Faculty, staff, and student-workers are prohibited from being under the influence of any \\ndrugs (including prescription drugs) that cause impairment and impact the ability of \\nemployees to perform their jobs. University employees with a license to operate \\nspecialized vehicles or equipment (e.g., commercial driver’s license or pilot’s license) must \\nfollow all applicable rules prohibiting the use of drugs before and/or while operating the \\nvehicle/equipment. III. Policy on Alcohol \\nThe unlawful manufacture, possession, distribution, sale, or use of alcohol is prohibited at \\nthe university. All members of the university community are expected to comply with applicable laws \\nregarding the possession, consumption, transportation, and distribution of alcohol. Except as set forth below or as otherwise prohibited by applicable departmental-level \\nrules, the lawful consumption of alcoholic beverages on university property (whether \\nowned or leased) and/or in connection with university programs by individuals of legal \\n', '146 \\n \\n \\ndrinking age (21 years or older in United States) is permitted by the university. In these \\ncircumstances, however, the university expects faculty, staff, students, contractors and all \\nother visitors to conduct themselves, both individually and collectively, in a responsible \\nmanner and in compliance with this policy. The consumption of alcohol and/or the possession of open containers of alcohol are \\nprohibited (i) while outdoors on university property, (ii) while inside university facilities in \\ncommon areas, theaters, galleries, dining facilities, or other spaces that are accessible by \\nthe public, (iii) while in classrooms, labs, studios, or other instructional spaces when a \\ncourse is in session, and (iv) at all on-campus athletic facilities. However, alcohol may be \\nserved and consumed in these locations where permitted under Section IV of this policy \\nconcerning Social Host and Alcohol Event Registration. All university employees, including faculty, staff, and student-workers, are expected to \\nobserve the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct. Faculty, staff and \\nstudent-workers who are of legal drinking age who choose to engage in the consumption \\nof alcohol are expected to do so responsibly. Faculty, staff, and student-workers are \\nprohibited from working while intoxicated or impaired. Furthermore, faculty, staff, and \\nstudent-workers are prohibited from consuming alcohol in a manner that in any way \\nimpairs the performance of job duties, endangers the physical well-being of oneself or \\nothers, or could result in the damage of property (in most circumstances, employees are \\nto refrain from consuming alcohol when performing their normal academic, \\nadministrative, technical, or professional duties). University employees with a license to \\noperate specialized vehicles or equipment (e.g., commercial driver’s license or pilot’s \\nlicense, etc.) must follow all applicable rules prohibiting the use of alcohol before and/or \\nwhile operating the vehicle/equipment. Sale of Alcohol \\nIn all cases, Carnegie Mellon complies with the law of the applicable jurisdiction regarding \\nthe sale of alcohol. Under Pennsylvania law, a liquor license is required to sell \\nalcohol. The university does not possess a liquor license. As such, alcohol may not be \\ndirectly or indirectly sold in connection with any university program or activity in \\nPennsylvania unless the alcohol is sold and/or served by a third-party that possesses a \\nvalid liquor license and, if necessary, an off-premises catering permit. The indirect sale of \\nalcohol includes, but is not limited to, the following: \\n• The sale of tickets, entrances fees, or required donations to attend an event where \\nalcohol is served; and \\n', '147 \\n \\n \\n• The use of drink tickets in connection with paid admission to an event where alcohol is \\nserved. IV. Social Host and Alcohol Event Registration \\nA “University Event with Alcohol” is a university event where alcohol will be served either \\n(1) on campus, or (2) off-campus where the alcohol is paid for directly, in whole or in part, \\nwith University funds, or where reimbursement, in whole or in part, is made for the \\npurchase of alcohol using University funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following \\nactivities are not University Events with Alcohol for purposes of Social Host and \\nregistration requirements (however, the other provisions of this Alcohol and Drug Policy \\nstill apply): \\ni. consumption of alcohol by students of legal drinking age in an on-campus private \\nresidence; \\nii. consumption of alcohol in an on-campus private residence that is leased, rented or \\notherwise occupied by an employee of the university, where no students are expected \\nand/or permitted to attend (excluding students who are relatives of the employee); \\niii. consumption of alcohol in a Private Office with a door and lock that is occupied by no \\nmore than four (4) faculty and/or staff members and where no students are present, \\nand \\niv. any events registered through the process that fraternities and/or sororities are \\nrequired to use in order to host an event with alcohol. As detailed in the Social Host & Alcohol Event Registration Procedures [pdf], a University \\nEvent with Alcohol must be registered with and approved in advance by the Office of the \\nDean of Students, and at least one Social Host must be designated for the University \\nEvent with Alcohol. These procedures set forth the requirements for University Events \\nwith Alcohol, the requirements for Social Hosts, and the types of events exempt from \\nthese requirements. The Social Host for each University Event with Alcohol is responsible for (1) ensuring that \\nalcohol is served only to individuals who are of legal drinking age (2) ensuring that \\nindividuals who are visibly intoxicated are not served alcohol, and (3) oversight of the \\nevent consistent with the Social Host Responsibility Guidelines set forth in the Social Host \\n& Alcohol Event Registration Procedures [pdf]. ', '148 \\n \\n \\nThe university will provide a legal defense and/or indemnity to any individual who serves \\nas a Social Host of a University Event with Alcohol, pursuant to the Social Host & Alcohol \\nEvent Registration Procedures [pdf], and subject to the attached Terms and Conditions for \\nSocial Host Defense and Indemnity [pdf]. The rights of faculty and Trustees and Officers of the University who serve as Social Hosts \\nare not governed by the Terms and Conditions for Social Host Defense and Indemnity \\n[pdf]. Rather, faculty defense and indemnity rights continue to be governed by Article VIII \\nof the University By-Laws concerning Professional Protection Regarding Faculty Members. Defense and indemnity rights of Trustees and Officers of the University continue to be \\ngoverned by Article IX of the University By-Laws concerning Liability and Indemnification \\nof Trustees and Officers. V. Sanctions & Medical Amnesty \\nFaculty, staff, and students who violate this policy may be subject to disciplinary action up \\nto and including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination of employment. Visitors to the \\nuniversity who violate this policy may be removed from university property and university \\nevents. Individuals who violate this policy may also be referred for criminal prosecution, \\nthough criminal charges are not a prerequisite for sanctions under this policy. Information \\nregarding the state and federal criminal penalties for violations of drug and alcohol laws, \\nas well as information regarding the health risks associated with the use of drugs and \\nalcohol, is available in the University’s annual Alcohol and Drug Brochure [pdf]. The university community values the health and safety of its members and supports an \\nenvironment that encourages students to come to the assistance of one another. As \\nspecified in the Active Medical Assistance Protocol students will be granted amnesty from \\nuniversity disciplinary action and University Police action when assistance from \\nemergency services personnel is appropriately sought for individuals in need of \\nimmediate medical attention due to alcohol or drug use. In the Commonwealth of \\nPennsylvania, similar amnesty from criminal prosecution is also available to individuals \\npursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. § 6308.1 and 35 P.S. § 780-113.7. VI. Resources \\nThe university provides the following resources to individuals seeking assistance relating \\nto the abuse of alcohol or drugs. ', \"149 \\n \\n \\n• Counseling & Psychological Services — Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is \\navailable as a resource to students for initial assessment of drug and alcohol use, and \\nreferrals to off campus outpatient and inpatient treatment programs. • University Health Services — University Health Services (UHS) also provides students \\nwith initial assessment of drug and alcohol use and referrals to CaPS or off-campus \\ntreatment programs, in addition to substance abuse prevention education, through its \\nOffice of Health Promotion. Individual sessions are offered alongside online programs \\nto assist students in assessing their own usage patterns and reducing the risks \\nassociated with substance abuse. UHS also facilitates the Collegiate Recovery \\nCommunity at the university to support and connect students and their allies who are \\nchoosing sobriety. Information about appropriate community support groups is \\navailable through CaPS and UHS. Some of the support programs available in the \\nPittsburgh area include: Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Al-Anon and \\nthe Adult Children of Alcoholics Network of Greater Pittsburgh. • Employee Assistance Program — Carnegie Mellon has established an Employee \\nAssistance Program (EAP), sponsored and paid for by the university, to facilitate \\nemployees' efforts to resolve problems that can affect job performance and general \\nwell-being. EAP services include counseling and support relating to substance abuse. Broadcasting \\nAll students who participate in commercial, off-campus television or radio broadcasts, \\nwebcasts or podcasts and use the Carnegie Mellon name should consult with the Media \\nRelations Department. These students should contact Media Relations at 412-268-2900 prior \\nto their participation. Code of Business Ethics and Conduct Policy \\nAuthority \\nCarnegie Mellon University has various well-established policies and principles (some of \\nwhich are referenced throughout this Code of Business Ethics and Conduct) which apply \\nto different aspects of the University’s business and operations. As a result of the recent \\nenactment of various federal regulations, it has become necessary to re-state some of \\nthese various policies and principles into one Code of Business Ethics and Conduct. \", \"150 \\n \\n \\nApplicability \\nThis Code applies to individuals who are paid by the University when they are working for \\nthe University, including faculty, staff and students when working for the University. These \\nindividuals are referred to in this Code as “members of the University community.”[19] \\nIntroduction and Purpose \\nThe University’s mission to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research \\nand creative inquiry, teaching, and learning requires all members of the University \\ncommunity to maintain the highest ethical and professional standards in all domains. Accordingly, all members of the University community are expected to honor this Code \\nwhen working for the University. This Code reflects the University’s well-established policies and principles governing the \\nbehavior of all members of the University community when working for the University, \\nand is intended to function as a useful summary of ethical principles and to emphasize \\nthe importance of observing these principles. As such, this Code draws on the ethical and \\nbehavioral standards set forth in many separate University policies and principles as well \\nas applicable laws. This Code supplements but does not supplant other applicable \\nUniversity policies and principles including, but not limited to, official University Policies, \\nthe Faculty Handbook and the Staff Handbook. Code of Business Ethics and Conduct \\na) Ethical and Professional Conduct. All members of the University community are \\nexpected to observe the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct, and to \\nconduct all business and related professional activities in good faith and with fairness, \\naccuracy, integrity and respect for others. The foregoing includes the requirement for \\nall members of the University community engaged in research activities to engage in \\nthe responsible conduct of research, and prohibits those members from engaging in \\nresearch misconduct, including fabrication, falsification or plagiarism in proposing, \\nperforming or reviewing research, or in reporting research results. All members of the University community are also expected to act with due recognition \\nof their position of trust and loyalty with respect to the University, and its students, \\nresearch sponsors and donors. When in doubt about the propriety of a proposed \\ncourse of action, a member of the University community should seek counsel from \\n \\n19 As required by agreement with the United States Department of Defense, the University's Software Engineering Institute (SEI) \\nhas a separate Code of Business Ethics and Compliance that contains additional requirement for SEI employees. \", \"151 \\n \\n \\ncolleagues, supervisors or University administrators who can assist in determining the \\nright and appropriate course. Existing University policies and principles on ethical and professional conduct include: \\n• Handling Alleged Misconduct in Research Policy \\n• Faculty Handbook: Statement on Academic Integrity \\n• Staff Handbook, Section II. 1: Employment Policies and Procedures - Our Expectations \\n[pdf] \\n• Human Subjects in Research Policy \\n• Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Guidance \\nb) Respect for Others. The University embraces diversity as a core value and is committed \\nto establishing a campus culture that reflects a fundamental respect for different ways \\nof living, working and learning. The University also is committed to the principle of \\nnon-discrimination, and does not tolerate discrimination or harassment on the basis of \\nrace, color, national origin, sex, handicap, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, age, veteran \\nstatus, sexual orientation or gender identity. Existing University policies and principles involving respect for others include: \\n• Carnegie Mellon University Statement of Assurance Policy \\n• Disorderly Conduct Policy \\n• Freedom of Expression Policy \\n• Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) \\n• Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Policy \\n• Workplace Threats and Violence Policy \\n• Riotous and Disorderly Behavior Policy \\nc) Conflicts of Interest and Commitment. A conflict of interest occurs when a member of \\nthe University community is in a position to influence a decision on policy or purchases \\nwhere he or she might directly or indirectly receive financial benefit or give improper \\nadvantage to associates. A conflict of commitment arises when a member of the \\nUniversity community's involvement in outside activities substantially interferes with \\nhis or her commitment to the University. All members of the University community \\nshould use good judgment, professional commitment and ethics to protect themselves \\n\", \"152 \\n \\n \\nand the University from potential conflicts of interest or commitment. A member of \\nthe University community with a potential conflict must, if the potential conflict \\ninvolves research activities, disclose as and when required by the University's Research \\nCompliance Office, and for other activities, should discuss and document the potential \\nconflict with the member's supervisor or University administrators who can assist in \\ndetermining the right and appropriate course. Existing University policies and principles involving conflicts of interest and \\ncommitment include: \\n• Policy on Consulting by Faculty \\n• Policy on Special Service Payments for Internal Consulting \\n• Policy on Conflict of Interest/Commitment \\n• Office of Sponsored Projects - Conflict of Interest  \\nd) Compliance with Laws and Regulations. The University is subject to numerous laws \\nand regulations that govern the various activities of the University as an employer, \\ngovernment contractor and institution of higher education. All members of the \\nUniversity community are expected to familiarize themselves with the federal, state \\nand local laws and regulations that apply to their activities and conduct themselves in \\ncompliance with such laws and regulations. Noncompliance, even when inadvertent, \\ncan have severe consequences to the members involved and the University, including \\ncivil liability, loss of funding, reputational harm and, in extreme cases, criminal \\nprosecution or sanctions. Questions about the interpretation or applicability of law or \\nregulations should be directed to the University's Office of the General Counsel. e) Compliance with Policies and Procedures. All members of the University community \\nare expected to familiarize themselves with and follow applicable University policies \\nand procedures. As part of this, each member of the University community also is \\nexpected to follow the policies and procedures enacted by the academic or \\nadministrative unit within which the member is working at the University. Questions \\nabout a specific policy or procedure should be directed to the individual or office \\nresponsible for oversight of that policy or procedure. Existing University policies and \\nprocedures include. Existing University policies and procedures include: \\n• Carnegie Mellon University Policies \\n\", '153 \\n \\n \\n• Faculty Handbook \\n• Staff Handbook [pdf] \\n• Human Subjects in Research Policy \\nf) Authority to Commit the University and Compliance with Agreements. In the ordinary \\ncourse of its business of education and research, the University enters into various \\nagreements, such as contracts, grants, licenses, gifts, purchase orders and other \\nbinding obligations, from federal and non-federal sources. Entering into an agreement \\nby the University, including sponsored research funding, creates a legal obligation on \\nthe part of the University to comply with the terms and conditions of that agreement, \\nincluding applicable laws and regulations. Therefore, only individuals who have \\nauthority delegated by an appropriate University official are authorized to enter into \\nagreements on behalf of the University. All members of the University community are expected to act in good faith and adhere \\nto all agreements and other binding obligations undertaken by the University. In \\nparticular, members of the University community involved in federally-sponsored \\nresearch activities must strictly adhere to all contractual obligations (including \\nadhering to applicable federal laws and regulations) related to those activities. Existing University policies and principles involving authority to commit the University \\nand compliance with agreements include: \\n• Signature Authority for Legally Binding Commitments and Documents \\n• Research Proposals: Government, Corporations and Foundations Policy \\n• Sponsored Research Policies and Procedures \\ng) Appropriate Treatment of Confidential and Private Information. Members of the \\nUniversity community may have access to confidential, proprietary or private \\ninformation of various types, including student records, employee records, University \\nbusiness information, personally identifiable information, intellectual property and \\nother information subject to contractual or legal obligations of confidentiality. All \\nmembers of the University community must follow all applicable legal, contractual and \\npolicy restrictions on the use, disclosure and safeguarding of such information. Existing University policies and principles involving appropriate treatment of \\nconfidential information include: \\n• Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Information Security Program \\n', \"154 \\n \\n \\n• HIPAA Policy \\n• Information Security Policy \\n• Policy on Privacy of Faculty Offices \\n• Student Privacy Rights Policy \\nh) Appropriate Use of University Resources and Accurate Financial Reporting. University \\nresources are reserved for University business purposes. Therefore, all members of \\nthe University community are expected to ensure that University resources, such as \\nfunds and other property are used appropriately for the benefit of the University and \\nin compliance with applicable laws and regulations and University policies and \\nprocedures. When required by their job responsibilities, members of the University \\ncommunity must record, allocate, document and/or report revenue, expenditures, \\ntime, effort and other information in an accurate, complete and timely manner. All \\nentries in University's books and records, including departmental accounts and \\nindividual expense reporting, must accurately reflect each transaction. Existing University policies and principles involving appropriate use of University \\nresources and accurate financial reporting include: \\n• Computing Policy \\n• Cost Transfer Policy for Sponsored Programs \\n• Intellectual Property Policy \\n• Property Management Policies and Procedures \\n• Business and Travel Expense Reimbursement Policy \\n• Petty Cash Policy \\n• Policy for Auxiliary and Recharge Service Centers \\n• Policy for Directly Charging Administrative Costs to Sponsored Research \\n• Purchasing Policy \\n• Responsibilities for Managing Carnegie Mellon University Financial Assets \\n• Separation of Individual’s and Institution’s Interests \\ni) Reporting Suspected Violations. Each member of the University community has the \\nresponsibility to ask questions, seek guidance and report suspected violations of this \\nCode or any other applicable law or regulation, contractual or other obligation of the \\n\", \"155 \\n \\n \\nUniversity or of University policy or procedure. Individuals are encouraged to report \\nsuspected violations through standard management channels, such as to their \\nimmediate supervisor or other appropriate University officials. However, an individual \\nwho for any reason feels uncomfortable reporting a suspected violation through \\nestablished channels may file an anonymous report through the University's Ethics \\nReporting Hotline: \\nCARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY ETHICS REPORTING HOTLINE \\nTOLL FREE: 844-587-0793  \\nVia the Internet: cmu.ethicspoint.com \\nReports of suspected violations may be made confidentially, and even anonymously, \\nalthough the more information that is given, the easier it is to investigate the reports. A \\nreport of a suspected violation is a service to the University and will not in itself jeopardize \\nemployment with the University. That is, no person who makes a good faith report of a \\nsuspected violation will be reprimanded or retaliated against in any way. j) Consequences of Violations. Violations of this Code or any other applicable law or \\nregulation, contractual or other obligation of the University or University policy or \\nprocedure may carry disciplinary or other consequences, including dismissal. Concessions, Solicitations, Lotteries & Raffles \\nConcessions \\nAny group or individual who wishes to sell merchandise or service of any description on \\nthe campus or in the buildings of the institution must present an application in writing to \\nthe dean of students. Written permits will be issued for approved applications. Solicitation of Funds \\nStudent organizations may solicit funds for use by the organization from students, alumni, \\nfamily or friends. Funds solicited using the University’s name or for which the donor \\nexpects to receive a charitable income tax deduction as a gift to the University must be \\nsolicited and used in compliance with the University’s solicitation and accounting rules. To \\nensure compliance with tax laws, these rules require gifts designated to a specific \\norganization be made through the University’s annual giving website or by deposit to the \\nOffice of Student Leadership, Involvement and Civic Engagement. \", '156 \\n \\n \\nLotteries and Raffles \\nLotteries, raffles or other devices of a like nature are governed by the laws of the \\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania and are therefore authorized on campus only when \\nrequired permits are obtained by the appropriate governing authority. Approval to host \\nan event deploying games of chance must receive approval from the director of student \\nleadership, involvement and civic engagement to ensure compliance with the law. Deadly Weapons Policy \\nObjectives \\nThis Policy is part of a broad initiative aimed at maintaining the university as a safe place \\nfor students, faculty, staff and visitors. The prohibition of deadly weapons on campus is a \\nproactive step toward reducing the risk of injury or death due to the intentional, \\naccidental, inexpert or improper use of firearms. Statement \\nDeadly weapons are not permitted on any property owned or controlled by the university. For the purposes of this policy, a deadly weapon is any device designed to produce death \\nor serious bodily injury.

It is recognized that there may be activities related to the educational mission of the \\nuniversity (e.g., physical fitness activities or theatrical productions) that may appear to \\nviolate the letter but not the intent of this policy. In such cases, the department or \\norganization coordinating the activity is responsible for obtaining written approval from \\nthe Chief of Police or his designee, in advance, to conduct the activity. Such approval may \\nextend for up to one year at a time. Violations \\nPersons who possess deadly weapons in violation of this policy will be required by \\nUniversity Police to remove the weapons and/or themselves from university property. Any university student, faculty or staff member who violates this policy shall be subject to \\naction in accordance with university disciplinary policies and procedures for students, \\nfaculty and staff.

Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nCarnegie Mellon University is committed to Equal Employment Opportunity and \\nAffirmative Action (EEO/AA). The university bases its employment decisions on the principle of equal employment \\nopportunity. All personnel actions including, but not limited to, recruitment, hiring, \\ntraining, promotion, compensation, benefits, transfer, layoff, return from layoff, education \\ntuition assistance and social and recreational programs are administered in accordance \\nwith the university's commitment to non-discrimination. \", \"165 \\n \\n \\nFurther, the university takes affirmative action to attract qualified candidates for \\nemployment who are minority, female, individuals with disabilities, disabled veterans and \\nveterans of the Vietnam Era; ensures that bona fide job-related and valid requirements \\nare used to evaluate employees for promotion and applicants for employment; and \\ncomplies with applicable federal, state and local laws, statutes, orders and regulations \\nprohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, age, national or \\nethnic origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, veteran status or non-job-related \\ndisability. Reason for the Policy \\nThis EEO/AA policy is a reminder of our commitment to equal opportunity and as an \\nupdate on current responsibilities. The university recognizes that its success depends on the development and use of the full \\nrange of human resources. At the basis of this precept is equal employment opportunity. It is critical that Carnegie Mellon's faculty, staff and student body continue to cultivate and \\nenhance its diversity. Through administration of this and related policies, the university \\nintends to assure that all people are included in the diversity that makes Carnegie Mellon \\nstronger in sustaining world-class distinction. Regulatory Compliance \\nThe university does not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in employment by \\nExecutive Order 11246, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act \\nof 1990, the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, Title VI of the Civil \\nRights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and other federal, state \\nand local laws. Consistent with the university's Policy Against Retaliation, employees and \\napplicants are protected from harassment, threats, coercion, intimidation, interference, \\ndiscrimination, or retaliation for filing a complaint or assisting in an investigation under \\nthe above statutes and executive order. The U.S. Department of Labor, including the Office of Federal Contract Compliance \\nPrograms (OFCCP) is responsible for the external administration and enforcement of the \\napplicable federal laws, rules and regulations cited in this policy. Accountability \\nThis policy was developed by Equal Opportunity Services and incorporates suggestions by \\nthe president, general counsel, vice president for business and planning, assistant vice \\npresident for human resources and director for equal opportunity services. \", \"166 \\n \\n \\nEqual employment opportunity and affirmative action must be supported by top \\nmanagement leadership to succeed. The president of the university is the chief officer \\nresponsible for oversight of Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action program. This \\nresponsibility is delegated through the provost, vice presidents, deans and department \\nheads, who support the president in maintaining the importance of EEO/AA as a critical \\ncomponent of university operations. Responsibility \\nThe broad-based efforts of all faculty and staff are key to meeting the university's equal \\nemployment opportunity commitments. At Carnegie Mellon, non-discrimination and \\naffirmative action are everyone's responsibility. In support of Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action and equal employment opportunity \\ncommitments, the Office of Human Resources has been charged with responsibility for \\ncoordination of the university's EEO/AA programs, which includes: developing and \\nimplementing procedures, policies and programs and bringing new initiatives to the \\nattention of senior administrators; formulating Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action plans \\nand monitoring and reporting results; and handling or referring complaints to appropriate \\nuniversity access points. EOS maintains communication with appropriate external \\norganizations in order to remain informed about employment and affirmative action \\nissues. The department also coordinates accommodations for individuals with disabilities, \\nas well as compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the \\nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment \\nAssistance Act (VEVRAA). Other individuals and offices carrying specific responsibilities for EEO/AA include: \\nFarnam Jahanian, \\npresident, 412-268-2200 \\nInvolved in all queries concerning the application of our \\nnon-discrimination policy as it applies to educational \\nprogramming, and works with the university's Faculty \\nReview Committee to resolve complaints regarding the \\napplication of Carnegie Mellon's policies as they apply to \\nfaculty. University \\nOmbudsperson,  \\n412-268-1018 \\nThe ombudsperson hears complaints, clarifies issues and \\nsuggests possible solutions to work-related problems. \", \"167 \\n \\n \\nFire Extinguisher & Sprinkler Systems \\nFire extinguishers and full-coverage sprinkler systems are provided in residence halls and \\nother university areas to increase the safety of the occupants. Activating or discharging them \\nfor any reason other than extinguishing a fire is a violation of university regulations and will \\nbe subject to disciplinary action. Freedom of Expression Policy \\nNote: In early September, 2017, the university convened a group to review this Policy in light of recent \\nevents on campuses around the country. Pending the outcome of that formal review later this semester, and \\nin order to enhance the environment for free expression at the university and ensure the safety of the \\ncommunity, the university is instituting an interim change to this Policy. Effective immediately, individuals \\nand organizations who are not Carnegie Mellon students, faculty or staff who wish to distribute printed \\nmaterial, offer petitions for signature, make speeches or hold protests or demonstrations outside University \\nbuildings, are required to meet the same standards for outdoor events as are already applied to events \\ninside campus buildings, including the requirements that events must have sponsorship from a member of \\nthe university community and must meet registration requirements. These interim changes will assure that \\nevents are planned thoughtfully, with the safety and security of members of our campus community being \\nparamount concerns. Students, faculty, and staff will still enjoy normal use of outdoor campus spaces \\naccording to university policy. Questions should be directed to Gina Casalegno, Vice President for Student \\nAffairs. Policy Statement \\nCarnegie Mellon University values the freedoms of speech, thought, expression and \\nassembly - in themselves and as part of our core educational and intellectual mission. If \\nindividuals are to cherish freedom, they must experience it. The very concept of freedom \\nassumes that people usually choose wisely from a range of available ideas and that the \\nrange and implications of ideas cannot be fully understood unless we hold vital our rights \\nto know, to express, and to choose. The university must be a place where all ideas may be \\nexpressed freely and where no alternative is withheld from consideration. The only limits \\non these freedoms are those dictated by law and those necessary to protect the rights of \\nother members of the University community and to ensure the normal functioning of the \\nUniversity. Rights \\nOn Carnegie Mellon's campus, anyone may distribute printed material, offer petitions for \\nsignature, make speeches, and hold protests or demonstrations outside university \\nbuildings. All such activities must be peaceful, avoiding acts or credible threats of violence \\n\", \"168 \\n \\n \\nand preserving the normal operation of the university. No event shall infringe upon the \\nrights or privileges of anyone not in sympathy with it, and no one will be permitted to \\nharm others, damage or deface property, block access to university buildings or disrupt \\nclasses. The enforcement of these conditions will not depend in any way on the message \\nor sponsorship of the act or event. When guests are invited by a recognized campus \\norganization, they may express their ideas not because they have a right to do so, but \\nbecause members of the campus community have a right to hear, see, and experience \\ndiverse intellectual and creative inquiry. Defending that right is a fundamental obligation \\nof the university. Controversy cannot be permitted to abridge the freedoms of speech, \\nthought, expression or assembly. They are not matters of convenience, but of necessity. Responsibilities \\nFreedom of expression must be at once fiercely guarded and genuinely embraced. Those \\nwho exercise it serve the Carnegie Mellon community by accepting the responsibilities \\nattendant to free expression. University organizations that sponsor invited guests to \\ncampus are expected to uphold Carnegie Mellon's educational mission by planning \\ncarefully to create safe and thoughtful experiences for those involved. Hosts are \\nresponsible for the behavior of their guests and should exercise due care to ensure that \\nall participants abide by relevant university policies. Considerations for Planning Campus Events \\nConsistent with the rights and responsibilities outlined in the university's policy on \\nFreedom of Expression, university hosts must follow all applicable policies related to \\nspace reservation, use, safety and security, keeping in mind the responsibility to have \\ncampus police present for any event with 100 or more persons in attendance. Hosts should consider the items below as guidance in planning campus events, \\nrecognizing that not all of the items below will apply to all events: \\n1. A public declaration of the event, its purpose, the identification of sponsors and co-\\nsponsors, and contact information for those seeking further information. 2. A plan for advertising the event, including advance notice to relevant members of the \\ncommunity who may wish to co-sponsor, protest, or host other events in response to \\nthe planned activity. 3. Where appropriate, a clear and detailed contract with outside speakers, artists, or \\nsuppliers of services to ensure continuity of purpose and the ability of the host to \\nreasonably control the event, consistent with the host's intent. \", '169 \\n \\n \\n4. A plan for access to the event, including notifying the community of reserved seats, \\nticketing, queuing protocol, or other relevant details or restrictions well in advance of \\nthe activity. 5. A provision for security before, during, and after events, managed in coordination \\nwith the University Police. Specifically, non-university security personnel must have \\ntheir allowable duties clearly delineated, in partnership with the University Police, \\nwith their role generally limited to personal security and not space management. 6. A plan for participant engagement at the event, such as through a question and \\nanswer session, if relevant, with a clear delineation of the planned ground rules for \\nthe event set out well in advance. 7. A strategy for hosting of additional events, discussions, or town meetings before or \\nafter a principal event to help provide a context in which the principal event may be \\nbest experienced. The Office of Student Activities and the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs may assist in, \\nor directly coordinate, some aspects of campus events, such as fostering discussions \\npreceding or following an event, or accommodating an opposing view at an alternative \\nevent. It is assumed that the spirit of community, both among people and groups with \\nopposing views, as well as between event sponsors and the Student Activities and Student \\nAffairs staffs, will foster communication and cooperation in the planning of campus \\nevents. Whenever possible, Student Affairs will work in concert with University Police to \\nnotify occupants of buildings in advance of any potential disruption caused by such \\nevents. Security Personnel Statement \\nAt times, members of the campus community or their invited guests may have a \\nlegitimate basis for being accompanied by independent security personnel. It is \\nincumbent upon the host of such an individual to ensure that the University Police \\napprove in advance the presence and scope of involvement of any such security \\npersonnel. Hazing \\nStudents have a right to be treated with respect and dignity by and among their peers. Hazing is inconsistent with Carnegie Mellon University’s values and is strictly prohibited. On \\nOctober 19, 2018, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted the Timothy J. Piazza \\n', \"170 \\n \\n \\nAntihazing Law. Consistent with Pennsylvania law, the university defines hazing as any action \\nor situation on or off campus that intentionally, knowingly or recklessly endangers the mental \\nor physical health or safety of a student or that willfully destroys or removes public or private \\nproperty for the purpose of initiation or admission to, affiliation with, or as a condition for \\ncontinued membership in, any organization operating under the sanction of or recognized by \\nthe university. Any such activity shall be presumed to be forced regardless of the individual’s \\nwillingness to participate. Students and/or recognized student organizations accused of violating this hazing policy or \\nviolating Pennsylvania criminal hazing laws (shared below) will be subject to investigation and \\nreview through the university community standards process, which could result in \\ndisciplinary action up to and including suspension or expulsion from the university for \\nstudents and loss of recognition for student organizations. Click here for more information about hazing prevention and response. Safe Harbor for Individuals Seeking Medical Attention Resulting from Hazing Activities \\nConsistent with the active medical assistance protocol expectations, an individual shall \\nreceive immunity from the university’s community standards process for allegations \\nstemming from violations of this policy if all of the following apply: \\n1. The university first became aware of the individual's alleged violation of this hazing \\npolicy because the individual called or contacted university police or student \\nemergency medical services, based on a reasonable belief that another individual \\nwas in need of immediate medical attention, that had otherwise not yet been sought, \\nto prevent death or serious bodily injury. 2. The individual provided their own name to the university dispatch operator or \\nequivalent security officer, police or emergency services personnel. 3. The individual requesting assistance remained with the individual believed to be in \\nneed of medical assistance until security, police or emergency services personnel \\narrived and the need for the concerned individual's presence had ended. Similar immunity from criminal prosecution for hazing offenses under Pennsylvania law is \\ndescribed under 18 Pa C.S.A. § 2210. \", \"171 \\n \\n \\nPennsylvania Definitions of Hazing Offenses: \\nHazing (18 Pa C.S.A. 2802)  \\nA person commits the offense of hazing if the person intentionally, knowingly or \\nrecklessly, for the purpose of initiating, admitting or affiliating a minor or student into or \\nwith an organization, or for the purpose of continuing or enhancing a minor or student's \\nmembership or status in an organization, causes, coerces or forces a minor or student to \\ndo any of the following: \\n1.

Carnegie Mellon will provide reasonable accommodations to students \\nwith disabilities who need special housing accommodations to ensure that students with \\ndisabilities receive comparable, convenient and accessible housing at the same cost as to \\nother students. Carnegie Mellon will make reasonable modifications to its housing \\npolicies, procedures and practices when such modifications are necessary to avoid \\ndiscrimination, unless such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the \\nhousing services provided by the University. Please visit the special accommodations page \\nfor full details about the housing accommodations policy, including applicable deadlines \\nand forms required when requesting special accommodations. Hoverboards \\nHoverboards are not permitted in all university operated housing (including residence \\nhalls, apartments, and Greek Houses). If you currently possess a hoverboard, we \\nrecognize that you may need assistance making shipping arrangements (due to postal \\nregulations) or storing it until a later date. Should you find yourself in this situation, please \\ncontact your Housing Services Facility Coordinator (FC) as soon as possible. Illegal Possession of Keys \\nStudents are responsible for access gained through the use of their assigned access \\ndevice. Access devices include keys, student ID card, or Mobile ID app. Swapping or \\nsharing or copying these items is not permitted as your name data is associated with your \\nassigned access device. Students found using or having in their possession any access \\ndevice for any university doors or facilities that they are unauthorized to use or possess \\nwill be subject to disciplinary action. Improper Use of University Facilities \\nImproper use of facilities will be construed as the occupation, alteration or use of \\nuniversity facilities that would create a potential fire hazard, safety hazard to any person \\nor property, or potential danger to any person or property. Inspection and Privacy \\nAuthorized representatives of the university may enter resident accommodations at any \\ntime to inspect facilities or to carry out repairs and maintenance. The inspection of \\n', \"180 \\n \\n \\nfacilities will be conducted with at least 24 hours prior notice in writing whenever that \\nnotice can be reasonably given. If any Housing Services or residential life staff member \\nenters a student room without a prior request or written notice, the student will receive a \\nreport documenting the time and purpose of entry. The university may authorize \\nentrance to an accommodation if convinced that a clear and present danger or a violation \\nof the university's regulations requires such entrance. (This regulation applies to campus \\nhousing as well as other university space.) \\nMail, Packages, and Deliveries \\nAll mail and packages for all campus housing residents must be addressed and sent to the \\nindividuals Student Mail Code (SMC) box. Mail and packages includes anything sent \\nthrough the United States Postal Service, UPS, FedEx, DHL, Amazon Prime, etc. No mail or \\npackages of any kind should be sent directly to the street address of the residence hall or \\napartment building. Housing Services bears no responsibility for the damage, theft, or \\nremoval of any packages that are sent directly to the building addresses. In order to \\nensure that your package and mail is safe and secure, you must send it to your SMC code \\naddress. All mail and packages should be addresses as follows: \\nFirst/Preferred Name and Last Name \\nSMC #### \\n5032 Forbes Avenue \\nPittsburgh, PA 15289 \\nDeliveries of food or groceries through a delivery service such as InstaCart or PostMates \\nshould only be placed when you will be present and available to accept delivery of your \\norder. Food or groceries that are delivered and not received directly by the resident may \\nbe removed and discarded as they create health issues and can attract unwanted pests. Microwave Ovens \\nResidents may bring their own compact microwaves to campus as long as they are under \\n700 watts. Open Flames and Combustible Materials \\nOpen flames or combustible/flammable materials of any kind, including (but not limited \\nto) candles, incense, flammable liquids and gases, pretreated charcoal, fireworks and \\nother such combustibles, are absolutely prohibited in university housing. \", '181 \\n \\n \\nOutdoor Poster Policy for Residential Areas \\nNo signs, posters or banners of any size shall be hung outside or around any residential \\nbuilding, except upon special request. This applies to all residence halls, apartment \\nbuildings and houses as well as fraternities and sororities. Special consideration may be \\ngiven, on request, for groups to use outdoor postings during university-wide special \\nevents. Requests for exceptions to this policy should be made to the Director of Housing \\nServices. Pets and Animals \\nExcept as set forth below, pets and other animals are not permitted in any university \\nhousing facilities, including fraternities and sororities. • Fish in an aquarium no larger than five (5) gallons are permitted in university housing \\nfacilities. • Emotional support animals may be permitted within a student’s personal living space \\nin a university housing facility, with prior written approval from the Office of Disability \\nResources. An emotional support animal is an animal that is necessary to afford a \\nperson with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling when there is \\nan identifiable relationship or nexus between the person’s disability and the assistance \\nthe animal provides. Requests for accommodations regarding emotional support \\nanimals should be submitted to the Office of Disability Resources. • Service animals are permitted inside university housing facilities but may be prohibited \\nfrom accessing certain environments where the presence of an animal presents a \\nhealth or safety risk (e.g. kitchens, laboratories, sterile facilities, etc.). Service animals \\nare defined as dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for \\npeople with disabilities. Student residents who wish to maintain a service animal in \\ntheir dormitory must first contact the Office of Disability Resources for more \\ninformation. For more information regarding service animals and emotional support animals please \\nvisit the special accommodations page. In addition, the following standards apply to service animals and/or emotional support \\nanimals maintained in university residence facilities: \\n \\n', '182 \\n \\n \\n1. Any emotional support animal or service animal must be healthy and free of \\ncommunicable disease. If appropriate for the animal, documentation of all \\nveterinarian recommended vaccination must be provided to the Office of Disability \\nResources. New proof of vaccination must be provided before the previous proof of \\nvaccination expires. 2. Dogs must be properly registered with the City of Pittsburgh. Registration \\ndocumentation must be submitted annually to the Office of Disability Resources. 3. Emotional support animals are only permitted in the approved student’s private living \\nspace. Animals are not permitted in any public or common spaces within the \\nresidence facility, except as necessary to bring the animal into and out of the building \\nas needed. Housing Services or the Office of Student Life may establish reasonable \\nrestrictions on how an emotional support animal is transported into and out of the \\nbuilding. 4. Emotional support animals approved by the Office of Disability Resources for \\nuniversity residence facilities are not permitted inside other campus buildings. See The Word. 5. Emotional support animals are not permitted in the private living spaces of other \\nresidents of the facility. 6. The student is responsible for any damages caused by the service animal or \\nemotional support animal in the student’s private living space or elsewhere. 7. The student is responsible for the behavior of the service animal or emotional \\nsupport animals, even when the student is not present in the living space. 8. The student is responsible for providing appropriate care for the service animal or \\nemotional support animal at all times, including the clean-up and disposal of any \\nwaste. Animal waste or bags containing animal waste cannot be placed in garbage \\nchutes or common area trash cans. 9. The service animal or emotional support animal may not be disruptive to the \\ncommunity. Disruptive animals may be removed. 10. Emotional support animals must wear collars and identification tags at all times. 11. Carnegie Mellon reserves the right to remove any animal that is not appropriately \\ncared for. To ensure that appropriate care is available at all times, students are \\n', '183 \\n \\n \\nencouraged to establish a plan to care for the animal in the event the student is \\nunable to do so (e.g. due to illness or emergency).', \"12. Carnegie Mellon reserves the right to establish other reasonable expectations or \\nrestrictions at any time to ensure the health or safety of the community. Individuals with concerns or complaints regarding animals in residence facilities should \\ncontact a Resident Assistant or University Police. Personal Property and Insurance \\nStudents are responsible for insuring their own personal property, including for losses \\ndue to fire, smoke, water and theft. The University is not responsible or liable for any loss \\nor damage to the students' personal property and does not provide any property or \\nliability insurance coverage for students' benefit. The University reserves the right to store \\nat no liability for a limited period of time (for a period not to exceed 30 days), discard or \\ndonate personal property or any other belongings remaining in an accommodation after \\nthe accommodation has been assigned to another student or has not been vacated by a \\nprescribed time. The University reserves the right to charge the student a fee for any \\nstorage of personal property or other belongings provided by it. Privacy and Behavior Standards \\nAll residents have the right to determine the private activity that takes place in their \\nassigned rooms. Members of the floor also have the right to determine community \\nstandards for the floor. Roommates have equal voice in determining the private activities \\nof the room, and one roommate's rights must not infringe upon another roommate's \\nrights. Public Lounge Facilities \\nAt the beginning of each academic year, a layout of each lounge area and its contents will \\nbe inventoried and may be posted in the lounge. The furniture and contents of the lounge \\nfacilities should not be removed from the lounges under any circumstances without the \\nexpressed authorization of the building's Facility Coordinator. In addition to disciplinary \\naction, student(s) found with common area furniture will be charged the standard hourly \\nlabor rate to return each piece to its proper location. Quiet Hours \\nQuiet hours for all residential areas are 8 pm - 8 am on Sunday through Thursday nights, \\nand Midnight - 9 am on Friday and Saturday nights. During finals week or reading days, \\n24-hour quiet hours will be in effect. For long vacation weekends, weekend hours will be \\n\", '184 \\n \\n \\nin effect until the night before classes resume. Courtesy hours exist at all other times, \\nduring which the right of residents to live in an environment free from bothersome noise \\nshould be respected. \"Quiet\" is defined as being unable to hear any noise at a distance of 10 feet from a room \\nwith a closed door. During \"courtesy\" hours, noise can be considered bothersome if it can \\nbe heard at a distance of 50 feet. The notion of \"courtesy\" more broadly involves structuring your activities so that other \\npeople in your living unit are not adversely affected by noise. In particular, all residents \\nare encouraged to carefully plan their use of sound equipment (such as stereos and TVs) \\nor their social gatherings so that the noise produced by them does not infringe upon the \\nrights of others. The established quiet hours stated above are the minimums for every residential area. If \\nyou or anyone in your living unit believes that quiet hours should be extended, contact \\nyour Resident Assistant (RA) or Student Dormitory Council representative. That person \\nhas the authority to conduct a vote of the people living in your area and, pending \\nunanimous approval, extended quiet hours will be implemented. If you have concerns in relation to quiet hours or courtesy hours in your living area, please \\nfeel free to consult your RA. The RA is your primary advocate in situations involving noise \\nviolations and can assist you by addressing any questions or concerns you may have. Quiet Living Areas \\nWelch and designated first-year housing areas offer quiet living, a particularly desirable \\nalternative to traditional on-campus housing for undergraduate students. This \\ndesignation provides an assurance to all residents in these buildings, and to all residents \\nin the surrounding area, that resident students will act with the highest degree of \\ncommon courtesy and respect for others in maintaining a particularly quiet and \\nunobtrusive environment. This designation includes a provision for an extension of the university’s current quiet \\nhours policy to 24 hours. As such, residents will be responsible for ensuring that the noise \\ngenerated within their apartments or residence hall room is not audible at a distance of \\nten feet from their apartment or residence hall room. Common courtesy will be expected; \\nresidents should respond to any request from a fellow resident to reduce the noise level \\nfrom their apartment or residence hall room, even if already within this guideline. The following specific guidelines will also exist: \\n \\n', \"185 \\n \\n \\n• Stereos, televisions and radios will be permitted but must be used only in accordance \\nwith the general policy. • Use of musical instruments will not be permitted. • Social events and private gatherings will be permitted; however, they must be very \\nsmall and are subject to the above standards. It is hoped that this designation of a quiet living area will allow students choosing this area \\nto maintain a residential environment which will enhance the academic atmosphere and \\nsupport the important goal of maintaining these special living environments offered on-\\ncampus. Refrigerators \\nResidents may bring their own mini-refrigerators to campus as long as they are smaller \\nthan 4.3 cubic feet and operate on 110/120 VAC. Residents who do not remove personal \\nmini-refrigerators upon checking out will have their student accounts charged $40 per \\nhour for removal and $160 for refrigerator disposal/recycling. Refrigerators are limited to \\none per student. Right to Housing Privileges \\nIn signing a Housing License Agreement, each resident agrees to abide by whatever \\nregulations may be established by the university, Housing Services, the Residential Life \\nstaff, the Student Dormitory Council or the individual living units. Any resident student \\nwhose conduct does not meet the standards established for the university community \\nmay be denied the privilege of campus residency. Room Condition Responsibility \\nAll residents of a room or apartment are equally responsible for the accommodation and \\nits furnishings. At the end of each academic year, any damages to a student's room will be \\ncharged to the occupants of that room. Room Alterations \\nStudents are not permitted to make permanent alterations to the furniture or structure of \\nrooms or other residential areas. Prohibited actions include (but are not limited to) \\npainting, drilling or nailing into the walls, and construction or renovations. Housing \\nServices maintains a rotation schedule that allows for all residential areas to be painted \\nand maintained on a regular basis. Students who make alterations to their room without \\nauthorization will be charged the cost of having the room professionally repaired. All \\n\", '186 \\n \\n \\ndecorations should be hung using removable temporary adhesives such as Command \\nstrips or painters tape and any additions to the room must be free standing and not \\nblocking exits. Security Camera Policy \\nHousing Services is committed to safety, security and our residential community\\'s quality \\nof life. All building entry doors are locked 24 hours a day and right of entry is granted \\nthrough access on an individual’s CMU ID card. Additionally, security cameras are located \\nat the main entrances and high pedestrian traffic locations on building perimeters. The \\nsecurity cameras are not monitored live unless deemed necessary by CMU Police and \\nrecordings obtained with the use of the cameras will be exclusively accessed by CMU \\nPolice for safety and law enforcement purposes. Recorded images will be stored for 30 days and will be erased unless retained as part of a \\ncriminal investigation, court procedure, or other necessary safety practice. A list of camera locations may be available by written request to the Director of Housing \\nServices or his/her designee. Smoking \\nAll residential areas within the university housing system including Fairfax Apartments \\nand Webster Hall are smoke-free living environments. This policy prohibits the smoking of \\ntobacco or any other substance in residential areas. In accordance with Housing Services \\npolicies, residents must also abide by policies prohibiting the use of any open flame for \\nany reason, including but not limited to the burning of candles, incense, etc. This \\ndesignation not only includes the actual residents of the area, but also extends to their \\nguests. As such residents will be responsible for ensuring that any violation of this policy \\nwill be reported to the proper authorities and any violations of this policy will be \\nappropriately enforced. The Smoke-free Living Policy was developed through the efforts \\nof students, faculty and staff to assist residents and their guests to maintain a residential \\nenvironment, which minimizes their exposure to second hand smoke and its impact on \\nthe health of others. Solicitation and Sales \\nUnauthorized sales and/or solicitation are expressly prohibited in any residence area. \"Solicitation\" is defined to mean any effort to ask for donations or contributions of money, \\ngoods or services. \"Sales\" are defined to mean any activity of offering a product or service \\nin exchange for money, goods or other services. In exceptional cases, an individual or \\ngroup seeking permission to be in the residential areas for the purpose of soliciting or \\n', \"187 \\n \\n \\nselling must receive written authorization from the Director of Housing Services or his/her \\ndesignee. In most cases, those recognized groups or individuals that receive permission to \\nbe in the residence halls will be restricted to tables reserved for such purposes in public \\nareas or lobbies. Swimming Pools and Hot Tubs \\nSwimming pools, hot tubs, and any other item containing large amounts of water are \\nprohibited because of the hazards associated with drowning, electrocution, water damage \\nand the weight of large volumes of water. Because we cannot guarantee that all necessary \\nsafety precautions will be taken, students are not permitted to have or use items such as \\nswimming pools, hot tubs, dunk tanks, or slip n slides in or around residential buildings. Reducing the size of the pool or tank does not remove the hazard. University Furniture \\nUnwanted room furniture cannot be stored during the academic year. Closet doors in \\nrooms and apartments also may not be removed. Do not, under any circumstances, leave \\nfurniture in the hallway corridors. Rooms with missing furniture at the end of the \\nacademic year will be charged the full replacement cost for each missing item. This also \\napplies to summer housing residents. Waterbeds \\nWaterbeds are prohibited in university housing because of the potential for significant \\ndamage to the residence halls and to students' personal property if a waterbed breaks or \\nis vandalized. Weapons Policy \\nIn accordance with the University Deadly Weapons policy, deadly weapons are not \\npermitted on any property owned or controlled by the university. Additionally paintball \\nguns, pellet guns, airsoft guns and realistic replica weapons are prohibited in and around \\nresidential buildings. Residents and guests who qualify for an exemption as outlined in \\nthe University Deadly Weapons policy must also receive written approval from the \\nDirector of Housing services or his/her designee. Window Screens \\nStudents are not permitted to remove screens from their windows. Missing screens or \\nscreens that have been removed from windows will be reinstalled at the student's \\nexpense. \", '188 \\n \\n \\nWires and Utility Lines \\nNo wire may be strung outside any living unit or any alterations made to any university \\nresidential building without the express permission of Housing Services. This includes \\nsatellite dishes, radio and television aerials. In addition, no student or student organization may alter or tap into university utility lines, \\ntelevision antenna wires or cable lines without the express permission of Housing \\nServices (in the case of resident facilities) or Facilities Management Services (in the case of \\nother campus buildings). Information Security Policy \\nPurpose \\nCarnegie Mellon University (\"University\") has adopted the following Information Security \\nPolicy (\"Policy\") as a measure to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of \\nInstitutional Data as well as any Information Systems that store, process or transmit \\nInstitutional Data. Scope \\nThis Policy applies to all faculty, staff and third-party Agents of the University as well as \\nany other University affiliate who is authorized to access Institutional Data. Maintenance \\nThis Policy will be reviewed by the University\\'s Information Security Office every five years \\nor as deemed appropriate based on changes in technology or regulatory requirements. Enforcement \\nViolations of this Policy may result in suspension or loss of the violator\\'s use privileges, \\nwith respect to Institutional Data and University owned Information Systems. Additional \\nadministrative sanctions may apply up to and including termination of employment or \\ncontractor status with the University. Civil, criminal and equitable remedies may apply. Exceptions \\nExceptions to this Policy must be approved by the Information Security Office and \\nformally documented. Policy exceptions will be reviewed on a periodic basis for \\nappropriateness. ', \"189 \\n \\n \\nDefinitions \\n• Agent, for the purpose of this Policy, is defined as any third-party that has been \\ncontracted by the University to provide a set of services and who stores, processes or \\ntransmits Institutional Data as part of those services. • Information System is defined as any electronic system that stores, processes, or \\ntransmits information. • Institutional Data is defined as any data that is owned or licensed by the University. Policies \\n01 \\nThroughout its lifecycle, all Institutional Data shall be protected in a manner that is \\nconsidered reasonable and appropriate, as defined in documentation approved \\nand maintained by the Information Security Office, given the level of sensitivity, \\nvalue and criticality that the Institutional Data has to the University. 02 \\nAny Information System that stores, processes or transmits Institutional Data shall \\nbe secured in a manner that is considered reasonable and appropriate, as defined \\nin documentation approved and maintained by the Information Security Office, \\ngiven the level of sensitivity, value and criticality that the Institutional Data has to \\nthe University. 03 \\nIndividuals who are authorized to access Institutional Data shall adhere to the \\nappropriate Roles and Responsibilities, as defined in documentation approved and \\nmaintained by the Information Security Office. Inspection of University Space \\nAuthorized representatives of the university may enter any university space at any time for \\nthe purpose of inspection of facilities or for the purpose of planning or carrying out repairs \\nand maintenance. Such inspections will normally be conducted according to announced \\nschedules, but the university reserves the right to enter the space without prior \\nannouncement. The university may authorize entrance to an accommodation if convinced \\nthat a clear and present danger or a violation of the university's regulations requires such \\nentrance. (This regulation applies to campus housing as well as other university space). \", \"190 \\n \\n \\nMissing Student Protocol and Confidential Contact \\nIn accordance with the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 (20 U.S.C. § 1092(j)), \\nCarnegie Mellon has adopted this Missing Student Notification Protocol. Each student has the \\noption to register a Confidential Contact person who will be notified by Carnegie Mellon if the \\nstudent is determined to be missing. Confidential Contact information will be kept confidential and will only be accessible by \\nauthorized personnel in furtherance of a missing person investigation. Students who wish to \\nregister a Confidential Contact for notification through the missing student protocol may do \\nso by logging into Student Information Online (SIO) on The HUB website and updating their \\n“Manage Family & Friends” information under the “My Info” tab. Missing Student Procedures \\nAny community member may contact the University Police or Office of the Dean of \\nStudent Affairs to report concern that a student may be missing. If the report did not \\noriginate through University Police, the information will be immediately conveyed to \\nUniversity Police to begin an investigation. If the University Police investigation determines that the student is missing, the university \\nwill notify the student's Confidential Contact no later than 24 hours after the \\ndetermination that the student is missing. If the missing student is under the age of 18 \\nand not emancipated, the university will contact a custodial parent or guardian, in \\naddition to the Confidential Contact. The university will also notify the appropriate local \\nlaw enforcement agency within 24 hours of the determination that the student is missing. In addition to notifying the Confidential Contact, the University is required to notify a \\ncustodial parent or guardian of the missing status of any student under the age of 18, and \\nnot emancipated. No Contact Agreements/No Contact Orders \\nCarnegie Mellon is committed to providing support and resources to any student who may \\nbe the recipient of persistent unwanted or harassing contact by another student. In certain \\ncircumstances, it may become necessary for the university to formalize an arrangement \\nbetween two students to no longer have contact with each other (direct or indirect) other \\nthan that which is necessary for either party to continue their academic pursuits. Such an \\narrangement is designed as a protective measure to help mitigate the potential for future \\nproblematic interactions between the two students. The arrangement may take the form of \\neither a No Contact Agreement or No Contact Order, as follows: \\n\", '191 \\n \\n \\nA No Contact Agreement (NCA) is a mutual agreement between two students who voluntarily \\naffirm that they will not have direct contact with each other, or make indirect contact through \\nthird parties, except for that which is necessary for their academic pursuits. An NCA does not \\nconstitute a finding of responsibility for violating university policy, nor does it preclude the \\npossibility of future review of any past interactions through the community standards \\nprocess. Following discussion and agreement to enter into the NCA, the two students will \\nreceive a letter confirming the terms of the agreement. In the event that a student declines to \\nenter into a requested NCA, an associate vice president of student affairs may elect to review \\nthe matter to determine whether a No Contact Order is warranted. Please see a sample No \\nContact Agreement (pdf). A No Contact Order (NCO) is a directive from an associate vice president of student affairs \\nindicating that two students may not have direct contact with each other, or make indirect \\ncontact through third parties, except for that which is necessary for their academic pursuits. An NCO may be issued: \\n• when, upon careful review, the associate vice president deems there is sufficient \\ninformation presented that doing so will safeguard students’ abilities to pursue their \\neducation in an environment free from unwanted contact. In such an instance, the NCO \\ndoes not constitute a finding of responsibility for violating university policy, nor does it \\npreclude the possibility of future review of any past interactions through the community \\nstandards process; or \\n• in connection with the community standards process, either as an interim measure during \\nthe pendency of the process and/or an outcome associated with a finding of responsibility \\nfrom the process. No Contact Orders issued after a finding of responsibility are most often binding only on the \\nresponding party. However, in limited circumstances, they may be mutual. Carnegie Mellon \\nwill carefully consider the individual circumstances of the situation, including the burden \\nplaced on the reporting party by issuing a mutual No Contact Order. Please see a sample No Contact Order (pdf). A student who receives an NCO may appeal the \\ndecision in writing to the dean of students (a NCO received as a sanction through the \\ncommunity standards process may be appealed via the appeal procedures set forth in the \\nCommunity Standards section of The Word). Once implemented, any violation of an NCA or an NCO will be vigorously pursued as an \\nalleged violation of community standards through the community standards process. An NCA \\nor NCO remains in effect until it has been terminated, in writing, by the Office of the Dean of \\n', '192 \\n \\n \\nStudent Affairs following a determination that the arrangement is no longer warranted or \\nnecessary. A student considering request of an NCA or NCO may discuss the situation with a \\nHousefellow, a College Liaison, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, the Office for \\nInstitutional Equity and Title IX, the Office of Community Standards & Integrity, the Office of \\nResidential Education, or University Police. Noise \\nMembers of the university community have a right to work, study, practice and live in an \\nenvironment free from disruptive noise. Acknowledging our desire to foster a vibrant campus \\nculture, which will necessarily involve some noise associated with campus activities, the \\nfollowing expectations are intended to guide thoughtful planning and decision-making by \\nstudents and student groups: \\nActivity occurring on Carnegie Mellon-owned or managed property that disrupts the normal \\ncourse of business or is otherwise disruptive to the university or surrounding communities is \\nrestricted during the following hours: \\n• Monday - Thursday: before 4:40 p.m. and after 6:50 p.m. • Friday: before 4:40 p.m. and after 10:00 p.m. • Saturday and Sunday: before 7:00 a.m. and after 10:00 p.m. To fully support our vision for campus life, it is necessarily the case that some organized \\nactivities will merit consideration for exception to these articulated hours. Such requests are \\nencouraged and should be submitted via this form to the Director of Student Leadership, \\nInvolvement, and Civic Engagement for review and approval. Any time that excessive noise results in a reasonable complaint from individuals within or \\nbeyond the campus, the responsible party is expected to reduce the volume immediately. Failure to meet such a request from a university official will be referred for disciplinary \\nreview, separate and apart from any citations or other actions that may be taken by law \\nenforcement authorities. Any individual who would like to make a complaint about excessive noise is encouraged to \\nimmediately direct it to University Police, (412) 268-2323, who will maintain a record of the \\ncomplaint in connection with their response. ', '193 \\n \\n \\nOn-Campus Emergencies \\nUniversity Police Emergency Phone Number: (412) 268-2323 \\nIf You Discover a Fire \\n1. If you can, quickly put out the fire using a proper fire extinguisher. Report the \\nincident promptly to University Police at (412) 268-2323. 2. If you see that a fire cannot be quickly extinguished, activate the nearest fire alarm \\nstation and evacuate the area. Basic Evacuation Instructions \\n1. Whenever an alarm sounds, evacuate immediately. If you can safely close all \\nwindows in your area before leaving, do so. 2. Close your door as you leave, making certain that you have your keys with you (heavy \\nconcentrations of smoke may make your return necessary). In dormitory buildings at \\nnight, turn the room lights on as you leave to signal your evacuation. 3. Help retard the spread of smoke and flames by closing fire doors behind you as you \\npass through the building. Fire doors should never be obstructed or blocked open. 4. Move quickly to the nearest building exit, but refrain from running. 5. Do not attempt to use elevators for evacuation purposes. 6. If you encounter heavy smoke, change your exit route to the next available exit. Help \\nguide others if you appear to be more familiar with the building. 7. As you exit, move well away from the building exterior to assure your safety and to \\nprovide ample room for responding firefighters and emergency equipment. No one is to re-enter an evacuated building until it has been determined safe to do so by \\nthe ranking fire department officer at the scene. Aid to the Physically Challenged \\nBlind and mobile persons should first be moved out of the rush of traffic, and then \\npromptly assisted to the nearest exit. Deaf and mobile persons may be unaware of the \\nneed to evacuate, and should be calmly advised and guided to the nearest available exit. ', \"194 \\n \\n \\nImmobilized persons \\nTo reduce the risk of personal injury, attempts to carry immobilized persons are \\ndiscouraged. Wherever stairs are a part of the evacuation route, the following procedures \\nare to be applied: \\n1. As soon as a fire alarm sounds, the physically impaired person is to be quickly moved \\nto reasonable safety, preferably to an enclosed room or space that smoke or flames \\ncannot easily enter. This action needs to be accompanied by a verbal explanation so \\nthat the person being assisted understands what is happening and why these actions \\nare being taken. Again, elevators cannot be used safely for evacuation purposes. 2. If a telephone is available, University Police (412-268-2323) should immediately be \\ncontacted and advised of the individual's name and location within the building and \\nthe phone number from which the call is being made. If alone, the disabled person \\nmay wish to remain on the phone with University Police. 3. If available, a companion, or other responsible person may stand by to remain with \\nand assist the physically challenged individual. 4. Upon clearing the building, a floor marshal or other designated person from the \\nsame floor area should alert responding firefighters and/or University Police to the \\nexact location of the person or persons. If it becomes necessary for removal from the \\nbuilding, this can then be carried out by trained, equipped, emergency personnel. Additional information can be found on the Environmental Health & Safety website. CMU Alert Emergency Notification Service \\nCMU-Alert is Carnegie Mellon's emergency notification service, which sends voice and/or \\ntext messages to your registered phone in the event of a campus emergency. All students are pre-registered for CMU-Alert. Faculty and staff are encouraged to register \\nfor the service (login required) if they have not already done so.

For the purposes of this Policy, this \\ndefinition does not include any vehicles which require a Pennsylvania driver’s license to \\noperate, such as gasoline-powered scooters and two-wheeled, seated vehicles which fall \\noutside the PennDOT definition of a “pedalcycle”. (See Pennsylvania Consolidated \\nStatutes, Title 75, § 102. at Definitions.) \\nOperation \\n• In any circumstances, anyone using a wheeled vehicle of any type must yield the right \\nof way to pedestrians. o Walk or carry your vehicle when campus traffic is congested. o Pass with caution on the left and alert the people around you before doing so. • Operators are required to operate at speeds that are prudent and reasonable under \\nexisting conditions. Speed limit of five (5) miles per hour shall be observed while on \\nshared paths with pedestrian traffic. • No person is allowed to operate any wheeled vehicle: \\no Inside any building; \\no On any pedestrian building access ramp; \\no On, across or through landscaped or grass areas. • The university strongly encourages bicycle and other wheeled vehicle operators to \\nwear a U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission approved helmet or equivalent \\nprotective device. • Operators traveling in a manner that is deemed unsafe by a University Police Officer \\nmay be issued the appropriate citation. • Any type of wheeled vehicle that requires a driver’s license is prohibited from \\noperation on shared-use paths on campus. These vehicles are only authorized for use \\non public streets and are subject to the regulations of the City of Pittsburgh and of the \\nPennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code. ', \"196 \\n \\n \\nRegistration \\nThe university's Transportation Services department allows you to register your bicycle or \\nother personal wheeled vehicle. There is no fee for registering. Registering can greatly \\nhelp in retrieving a bicycle or other vehicle in case of theft. It also allows the university to \\ncontact the owner for retrieval if the vehicle is parked improperly or abandoned. Parking \\nA personal wheeled vehicle is parked/stored on campus at the risk of its owner. For \\noperators' convenience, bicycle racks are provided at various campus locations. These \\nracks are appropriate for bicycles and other two-wheeled vehicles. Information \\nabout using bicycles and wheeled vehicles on campus, including a list of rack locations, \\ncan be found on the Transportation Services website. In order to maintain campus \\naccessibility for all users, no wheeled vehicle shall be parked, stored, or left standing in \\nsuch a manner as to: \\n• Block entrance to or exit from any building or structure on campus; \\n• Block outdoor walkways or stairs; \\n• Impede the movement of persons with disabilities; \\n• Inhibit the full use of campus infrastructure, such as benches, handrails, ramps, \\nrailings, and other such furniture; \\n• Damage or potentially damage trees, artworks or landscaping; \\n• Impact any other location in a way that violates federal, state or local fire and safety \\nregulations. Personal wheeled vehicles left in such areas will be removed immediately and \\nimpounded. Finally, the use of any indoor area for wheeled vehicle parking is restricted when, in the \\nbest judgment of the person(s) responsible for that area, storage therein interferes with \\nthe routine activities normally conducted in that area. When accessing an indoor parking \\narea (i.e. designated indoor parking rooms, personal offices, etc.), vehicle owners should \\nuse the most direct path to avoid impedance of indoor pedestrian traffic. Removal and Impoundment of Wheeled Vehicles \\nAny University Police Officer, Transportation officer, or official authorized by the university \\nmay remove and impound any wheeled vehicle which: \\n• Is parked in violation of any of the sections of this policy; \\n• Appears to have been abandoned as evidenced by signs of disuse or neglect. \", '197 \\n \\n \\nBicycles or other wheeled vehicles impounded may be recovered only upon proof of \\nownership and after required fees are paid. Owners are responsible for all costs involved \\nin removal and storage of impounded items. Unclaimed wheeled vehicles shall be held for a minimum of six months by Transportation \\nServices, at which time the owner shall be presumed to have relinquished legal title. Such \\nbicycles shall be disposed of through proper legal procedure. The CMU Police Department, Facilities Management Services, Transportation Services, or \\nother university departments are not responsible for any alleged damage or loss of \\naccessories or equipment of an impounded vehicle. Pets \\nPets are permitted outside on campus grounds when leashed and properly attended. No \\nanimal may be left tied to trees or other objects on campus. In all cases the owner of the \\nanimal is responsible for the animal’s behavior and any damage caused by the animal. Except as noted below, students and their guests are not permitted to bring dogs, cats or \\nother pets inside any university buildings, including residence facilities, fraternities and \\nsororities, classrooms, and other academic or administrative facilities. More information regarding service and emotional support animals can be found through \\nthe Office of Disability Resources. More information regarding pets and housing policies can be found on the Housing Policies \\nwebsite. Students or student organizations that would like to host an on-campus activity or event that \\ninvolves animals (such as a petting zoo) must receive prior permission. Such requests are \\nencouraged and should be submitted via this form. Students are expected to properly respect, attend to, care for and treat any pets or animals \\nthat they maintain or interact with in any capacity. Community members should contact University Police if a problem arises with any animal. Any unattended animal(s) will be picked up and impounded by University Police or Animal \\nControl officers. Guidelines for how impounded animals are handled in the City of Pittsburgh, \\nwhich can include adoption or euthanasia. ', \"198 \\n \\n \\nPolicy Against Retaliation \\nIt is the policy of Carnegie Mellon University to protect from retaliation any individual who \\nmakes a good faith report of a suspected violation of any applicable law or regulation, \\nuniversity Policy or procedure, any contractual obligation of the university, and any report \\nmade pursuant to Section 9 of the Carnegie Mellon University Code of Business Ethics and \\nConduct. Carnegie Mellon faculty, staff, and students shall not in any way intimidate, reprimand or take \\nretaliatory action against any individual who makes a good faith report of a suspected \\nviolation.

The Trademark Licensing Office and Marketing and Communications protect the use of \\nthe official tartan(s) associated with Andrew Carnegie and Carnegie Mellon.\", '', \"200 \\n \\n \\nCarnegie Mellon University has registered many of its trademarks in the United States and \\nin foreign countries. For questions concerning whether a particular mark is a Carnegie \\nMellon trademark, please contact the Trademark Licensing Office. Using Carnegie Mellon Trademarks \\nCarnegie Mellon's trademarks are intended to present a positive image of the university. All trademarks should be used in an appropriate manner for the benefit and promotion of \\nthe university. Carnegie Mellon trademarks may not be altered in any way. The university's trademarks may not be used in any manner that suggests or implies an \\nendorsement of other organizations, companies, products, services, political parties, or \\nreligious organizations. The university's trademarks may not be used in any way that will discriminate against any \\npersons or groups based on age, ancestry, belief, color, creed, disability, national origin, \\nrace, religion, sex, sexual orientation or veteran status, or in any other way that would be \\na violation of the university's anti-discrimination policies. Internal Use of Carnegie Mellon Trademarks \\nSubject to the paragraph immediately following, members of the university community, \\nincluding faculty, staff, students, student organizations, and academic colleges, schools, \\ndepartments, centers, etc., should seek written approval from the Trademark Licensing \\nOffice prior to producing or having produced any products bearing Carnegie Mellon \\ntrademarks.

Policy on the Protection of Children in Carnegie Mellon University \\nPrograms, Activities and Facilities \\nPolicy Statement \\nThe mission of Carnegie Mellon University includes creating and disseminating knowledge \\nand art through research, creative inquiry, teaching and learning and transferring our \\nintellectual and artistic product to enhance society in meaningful and sustainable ways. Pursuing this mission includes engagement, outreach, and service to the community. In \\nparticular, Carnegie Mellon endeavors to support improvements in early childhood \\neducation, primary and secondary education, including pre-college, through research, \\neducation, recreation, and community service. These endeavors also enhance the \\nprofessional and personal growth of Carnegie Mellon students. This engagement with the \\nbroader community necessarily involves interaction with minor children (under the age of \\n18). Carnegie Mellon is committed to providing a safe and secure environment for all \\nminors involved in any programs or activities conducted on university premises, as well as \\nany off-campus programs or activities sponsored by the university. This Policy sets forth \\nthe university’s legal obligations, requirements for and expectations of faculty, staff, \\nstudents, contractors, and volunteers who operate and/or participate in such programs. The purpose of this Policy is to ensure the safety and well-being of minors while setting \\nhigh standards to encourage the pursuit of excellence in our engagement, outreach, and \\n\", '204 \\n \\n \\nservice to the community. All members of the Carnegie Mellon community, including \\nfaculty, staff, students, contractors, and volunteers, are expected to act in accordance with \\nthis policy. This policy describes three separate and independent requirements:  \\n• First, in Section II, it describes a “Program Registration” requirement which will allow \\nthe university to ensure that programs involving minors satisfy the requirements of \\nthe Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law, as amended by Pennsylvania Act 153, \\nas well as other best practices related to health, safety, program operation, parental \\npermission, risk management, etc. • Second, in Section III, the Policy sets forth the requirements for background \\ncertifications that are required by the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law when \\nworking with minors. These requirements are independent of the program registration \\nrequirements in Section II. Before working with minors, please make sure of your \\nobligations under both Sections II and III. • Third, in Section IV, the Policy sets forth the requirements for the mandatory reporting \\nof suspected child abuse under the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law. I. Definitions \\n• The terms “child,” “minor” and “minor child” are defined as any individual less than \\neighteen (18) years of age.* \\n• “Matriculated Student” is defined as a student who is enrolled at Carnegie Mellon and \\npursuing a program of study that results in a postsecondary credential, such as a \\ncertificate, diploma or degree.*  \\n• “School Employee” is defined as an individual who is employed by Carnegie Mellon or \\nwho provides a program, activity or service sponsored by Carnegie Mellon. This \\nincludes any faculty member, staff member or student-employee.* \\n• \"Responsible Individual\" is defined as the individual designated by a program or \\nactivity involving minors who is responsible for the administration of the program and \\ncompliance with this Policy. Depending on the nature of the program or activity \\ninvolving minors, the responsible individual may be a faculty member, staff member, \\nstudent, contractor, volunteer or a third-party. ', '205 \\n \\n \\n• For purpose of Section II of this Policy, \"Programs and Activities Involving Minors\" is \\ndefined as any program, event, or activity involving one or more individuals under the \\nage of 18 that is either: \\no Sponsored, funded and/or operated by any Carnegie Mellon administrative unit, \\nacademic unit, or student organization, regardless of location. This includes \\nprograms and activities conducted on-campus, off-campus, or remotely via the \\ninternet or other means of communication; or \\no Sponsored, funded and/or operated by a third-party entity and conducted on \\nuniversity property. The definition of Programs and Activities Involving Minors does not include: [20] \\n• Academic courses and related programs or activities, where the only minors involved \\nare Matriculated Students, visiting prospective students and visiting / non-degree \\nstudents. (Note: The University Registrar’s Office monitors non-degree students who \\nare minor children and such students are only permitted to register for a class if the \\ninstructor, in his/her sole discretion, is willing and able to obtain appropriate \\nbackground certifications under Pennsylvania law.) \\n• Any program or activity conducted on University property where the only minors \\ninvolved are Matriculated Students and/or visiting prospective students. • Intercollegiate events where the only minors involved are Matriculated Students or \\nstudents enrolled at another institution of higher education. • Events open to the general public where parents/guardians are required or expected \\nto provide supervision for their children (e.g. a sporting event or a theater production). • Minors who are employees of Carnegie Mellon and are paid at least a minimum wage \\n(note: co-workers of employees who are under the age of 18 may be required to \\nobtain background certifications under Pennsylvania Law).[21] \\n \\n20 Exclusion from the definition of Programs and Activities Involving Minors does not necessarily exempt individual faculty, staff, \\nstudents, contractors, volunteers, or other third parties from compliance with the requirements of Section III regarding \\nbackground certifications. Rather, exclusion from this definition exempts the activity from the registration requirements in \\nSection II. * These definitions are based on the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law. 21 Unpaid internships (where permitted by applicable government regulations and HR guidelines) are not exempt from the \\ndefinition of Programs & Activities Involving Minors. ', \"206 \\n \\n \\n• Human subjects research studies involving minor children that have been approved by \\nthe Institutional Review Board (note: the Office of Research Integrity Compliance will \\nnotify Child Protection Operations of any human subjects research studies involving \\nminors so that there will be no need to separately register). • Routine interactions between family and friends. II. Requirements for Programs and Activities Involving Minors \\nAll programs and activities involving minors must satisfy the following requirements: \\n1. All programs must register with Child Protection Operations, within the Office of \\nHuman Resources, and receive approval prior to engaging in any interactions with \\nminors. Child Protection Operations will coordinate with each program or activity to \\ndevelop appropriate procedures and training to ensure the welfare and security of \\nminors who participate in the program. 2. The review process conducted by Child Protection Operations will be based on the \\nunique circumstances of each program and include consideration of the following \\nkey factors, among others: the nature of the program; the duration of the program; \\nthe entity sponsoring the program; the responsible individual(s); the number of \\nparticipants and age ranges; the number of supervising adults; the facilities to be \\nused; use of overnight accommodations; potential health and safety concerns (e.g., \\nlaboratory use, machinery, swimming pools, motor vehicles); transportation; \\nprotocols for accidents, injuries and emergencies; health and wellness plans; \\nprotocols for drop-off and pick-up; and one-on-one private interactions with minors. 3. Written permission must be obtained from each minor's parent/guardian prior to the \\nminor's participation in any program administered by Carnegie Mellon and/or any \\nprogram administered by a third party on Carnegie Mellon property. 4. Each program must identify a responsible individual who will be responsible for the \\nadministration of the program and compliance with this policy. Notwithstanding the \\nrequirements of and/or exceptions to the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law \\nor similar laws of other jurisdictions, the responsible individual must have valid \\nbackground certifications under the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law or \\nsimilar laws of the applicable jurisdiction. 5. In addition to background certifications required by law as described in Section III \\nbelow, each program must ensure that at least one individual who has received \\n\", '207 \\n \\n \\ncertifications under the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law and appropriate \\ntraining is on site during the program or activity. That is, even if applicable law does \\nnot require any individual in a program to obtain background certifications, at least \\none individual on site during the program or activity must have a background \\ncertification and appropriate training. 6. The college, department, unit, or student organization sponsoring the program may \\nadopt background certification standards more stringent than the minimum required \\nby law, such that any individuals participating in a program may be required to \\nobtain background certifications even where such certification is not required by the \\nPennsylvania Child Protective Services Law or other applicable laws. III. Background Certification \\nAll faculty, staff, students, contractors, and volunteers must satisfy the background \\ncertification requirements for interacting with minors in the applicable jurisdiction. Specifically, it is the policy of Carnegie Mellon University to comply with the background \\ncertification provisions of the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law (23 Pa C.S.A. § \\n6303 et. seq.), as amended by Pennsylvania Act 153 of 2014. Detailed information \\nregarding the requirements of and exceptions to the Pennsylvania Child Protective \\nServices Law is available on the Human Resources website.[22] \\nThese background certification requirements are separate from the program registration \\nrequirements set forth in Section II. Even though a position, activity, or program does not \\nmeet the definition of program or activity involving minors requiring registration under \\nSection II, the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law (or similar laws in other \\njurisdictions) may still require background certifications. As noted above, the University Registrar’s Office monitors non-degree students who are \\nminor children and such students are only permitted to register for an undergraduate or \\ngraduate class if the instructor, in his/her sole discretion, is willing and able to obtain \\nappropriate background certifications under Pennsylvania law. 22 The Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law (CPSL), as amended by Pennsylvania Act 153, requires any University employee \\nwho has Direct Contact (as that term is defined under the CPSL) with children under the age of 18 to obtain certain background \\ncertifications. However, the CPSL does not apply to University employees whose only interactions with children under the age of \\n18 are limited to matriculated students and/or visiting prospective students. As such, most employees of Carnegie Mellon are not \\nrequired to obtain background certifications in order to perform their job duties. But if an employee’s duties include direct \\ncontact with children under the age of 18 who are not matriculated students or visiting prospective students, the employee may \\nbe required to obtain background certifications under the CPSL. For more information see https://www.cmu.edu/hr/career/new-\\nemployees/first-day/act-153.html. ', '208 \\n \\n \\nEvery employee and volunteer who is subject to the background certification \\nrequirements of this section has an obligation to notify the university if he/she is arrested \\nfor, or convicted of, any offense prohibited by the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services \\nLaw. Notice of arrests or convictions must be provided within 72 hours. Notice should be \\nsubmitted to Child Protection Clearances within the Office of Human Resources. If the university receives notice of an arrest or conviction for a prohibited offense or has \\nreasonable cause to believe that an employee or volunteer has been arrested or \\nconvicted of a prohibited offense, the university will require the employee or volunteer to \\nimmediately obtain new background certifications. In such cases, the university may \\nprohibit the individual from working with minor children pending receipt of new \\nbackground certification. IV. Mandatory Reporting \\nUnder the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law all school employees are mandatory \\nreporters of child abuse. Volunteers who are responsible for the welfare of a minor or \\nwho have direct contact with minors are also Mandatory Reporters. Reports of child abuse must be immediately submitted to both: \\na) The Pennsylvania Department of Human Resources. Reports may be submitted: \\na. Orally via the Child Hotline at 1-800-932-0313; or \\nb. Electronically via the website https://www.compass.state.pa.us/cwis/public/home. b) Carnegie Mellon University Officials. Reports may be submitted to: \\na. Your supervisor, or \\nb. University Police, or \\nc. Office of General Counsel \\nBy law a mandatory report must be immediately filed if there is reasonable cause to \\nsuspect that a minor is the victim of child abuse in the following circumstances: \\n• The Mandatory Reporter comes into contact with the minor in the course of \\nemployment, occupation and practice of a profession or through a regularly scheduled \\nprogram, activity, or service; \\n• The Mandatory Reporter is directly responsible for the care, supervision, guidance, or \\ntraining of the minor, or is affiliated with an agency, institution, organization, school, \\nregularly established church or religious organization or other entity that is directly \\nresponsible for the care, supervision, guidance or training of a minor; \\n', '209 \\n \\n \\n• A person makes a specific disclosure to the Mandatory Reporter that an identifiable \\nminor is the victim of child abuse; \\n• An individual 14 years of age or older makes a specific disclosure to the Mandatory \\nReporter that the individual has committed child abuse. Members of the university community located outside of the Commonwealth of \\nPennsylvania are expected to comply with any mandatory reporting laws of the applicable \\njurisdiction. Questions regarding mandatory reporting requirements in other jurisdictions \\nshould be submitted to the Office of the General Counsel. Additional information about mandatory reporting laws in Pennsylvania as well as other \\njurisdictions is available at https://www.cmu.edu/ogc/Guidance/act_153/. Prematriculation Immunization Policy \\nPolicy Rationale \\nThe university values personal and community health and recognizes the critical role that \\neach individual plays in contributing to community health by participating in personal \\nhealth care practices that prevent the spread of contagious diseases. Participation in a \\nvaccination program represents one such highly effective personal health practice. Vaccine-preventable diseases pose a significant threat to the public health of the campus \\ncommunity, impose a significant cost to infected individuals in terms of mortality and \\nmorbidity and impose a cost to other community members by disrupting university life \\nand academic activities. Therefore, the university expects that all individuals will value the \\nimportance of protecting themselves and others by obtaining vaccinations against \\nvaccine-preventable diseases and acknowledges the institution’s role in supporting public \\nhealth by monitoring the vaccination status of incoming students through its policy on \\nimmunization requirements. Policy Statement \\nThe goal of the university is to provide adequate protection of the campus community \\nagainst vaccine-preventable diseases. This goal can best be achieved through a \\nprematriculation immunization requirement that is administered by University Health \\nServices (UHS). All students are required to comply with the immunization requirements \\nand the screening protocol for tuberculosis. ', '210 \\n \\n \\nImplementation Guidelines \\nImmunization Requirements for Students \\n• Required vaccinations shall be determined by UHS and shall be consistent with \\nPennsylvania State Law and informed by the recommendations of the American \\nCollege Health Association and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. • Vaccination requirements will be reviewed annually by UHS. Any changes in the \\nrequirements effective  in the upcoming school year will be communicated to \\nincoming students and the university community in the spring term prior to \\nimplementation that fall. • Application or modification of this policy for non-Pittsburgh locations will be \\ndetermined by the Director of University Health Services, in consultation with \\nrelevant colleagues in those locations. Additional Requirements for Students Residing in University Housing \\n• Because vaccine preventable diseases spread more readily in a residential \\nenvironment, UHS may set additional requirements for students who elect to live in \\nuniversity housing. Request for Waiver \\n• A student may request a waiver from any vaccination for medical reasons or if \\nvaccination conflicts with personal or religious beliefs by contacting UHS. If an \\noutbreak of contagious disease occurs, the university reserves the right to ask \\nstudents who have not been vaccinated against that disease to leave campus until \\nthe outbreak is over. Screening Protocol for Tuberculosis \\n• Students with an increased risk of exposure to tuberculosis are expected to comply \\nwith screening requirements as set forth by UHS and informed by recommendations \\nof the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control. Penalty for Noncompliance \\n• If a student fails to comply with the immunization policy, UHS will notify the University \\nRegistrar who will change the student’s enrollment status to reflect that the student is not \\nenrolled until the requirements are met. ', '211 \\n \\n \\n• Additionally, if the student is a resident in university housing and fails to comply with the \\nimmunization requirements, he/she will be removed from housing. A fee may be assessed \\nby Housing for reactivation of the room key if the student later complies with the policy. Related Policies and Procedures \\nThe university complies with OSHA regulations regarding occupational exposure to blood-\\nborne pathogens. Questions regarding these regulations should be directed to \\nEnvironmental Health & Safety, 412-268-8182. Public Art Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nPublic Art is permanent or long-term art in public spaces on campus. This policy \\naddresses the review, acquisition, acceptance, siting, and deaccessioning of public \\nart. Accepted public art becomes the management responsibility of the Department of \\nCampus Design and Facility Development in the Office of the Vice President for Finance \\nand the Chief Financial Officer. Art enhances the quality of life for all people and should be a part of the daily life of the \\nstudents, faculty, and staff at Carnegie Mellon. Carnegie Mellon is a leader in education \\nfor the arts and creative research and practice, and art on the campus and in public \\nbuilding spaces should reflect this leadership status. Acquired public art should expand \\nthe educational mission of the university and the College of Fine Arts by providing \\ninteresting and challenging work of high quality, accompanied by an interpretive program \\nto make the works accessible to the non-specialist. The Public Art Committee (PAC) is established to: \\n1. Review specific proposals for public art with the purpose of recommending to the \\npresident approval, suggestions for modification, or rejection of the public art, and its \\nsiting. 2. Clarify the need for public art on the Carnegie Mellon campus and target specific \\nsiting opportunities, including both indoor and outdoor public spaces. This work \\nbuilds on the campus master planning process. Public art is acquired through donations, solicitations, purchases, and loans. It should be \\nrecognized that the advocacy and selection of public art can be controversial and, at \\ntimes, technically difficult. Public art selection must address such issues as: artistic \\n', \"212 \\n \\n \\nquality, appropriateness, site context, public sensibility, durability, maintainability, safety \\nand cost. Given the world class stature of our College of Fine Arts and many of its graduates, the \\nuniversity would be particularly pleased to have the opportunity to consider works by \\nprominent alumni and faculty to celebrate their leadership contribution to their discipline \\nand the world of art. As the university's financial strength becomes more robust and such funds become \\navailable, it is the university's aspiration that major new campus facilities projects will \\nallocate a percentage of project funds for the acquisition, commission and/or integration \\nof public art that will enhance the contribution of the new facility to the quality of campus \\nlife. If acquisition funding can be raised, consideration must also be given to maintenance \\nand the future maintenance of the art endowed. Definition \\nPublic Art at Carnegie Mellon is considered to be permanent or long-term art in public \\nspaces on campus, including all outdoor campus space and interior public spaces such as \\nlobbies, social spaces, etc. The PAC does not presume any authority over works of art, \\nphotographs, etc. that faculty and staff place on view in their offices or that departments \\ninstall in their offices and teaching spaces. Art is considered permanent if it is installed \\nwith no anticipated time limit or duration. This policy does not address student or faculty \\nart installations with a defined time limit, and which are covered by separate guidelines \\nand coordinated by the College of Fine Arts. Process \\nThe Public Art Committee is advisory to the president and all proposed public art and its \\nproposed site must be reviewed by the Public Art Committee and approved by the \\npresident and the Property and Facilities Committee of the Board of Trustees before it is \\naccepted by the university. The PAC meets on an ad hoc basis as public art proposals \\nrequire review, or to address other public art planning issues. Recommendations of the \\nPAC shall be upon a vote of the majority of members convened. The Design Review \\nCommittee must be consulted on proposals for outdoor sites that require integration into \\nthe campus master plan. In order to ensure that the PAC has the opportunity to receive input from all campus \\nconstituencies, prior to recommending acceptance of a piece of public art the PAC shall \\nhold at least one public meeting which all interested members may attend for purposes of \\nhearing about and offering comment on the proposed piece. Representatives of the \\nprimary user(s) of the space where the public art is to be sited must also be consulted. \", '213 \\n \\n \\nCarnegie Mellon welcomes temporary installations in public spaces organized by \\ndepartments or individuals. There is no need for the PAC to monitor short exhibits (six \\nweeks or less). Exhibits of the Miller Gallery are also exempted from review by the PAC. Public Art Committee Membership \\nThe PAC is chaired by the dean of the College of Fine Arts. An appropriate staff member \\ndesignated by the provost shall provide administrative support. The PAC is made up of \\ncampus representatives who provide necessary judgmental and technical \\nexpertise. Members shall include: \\nEx officio  \\n• Dean, College of Fine Arts (Chair) \\n• Head, School of Art \\n• Director, Miller Art Gallery \\n• Associate Vice President for Campus Design and Facility Development (non-voting) \\n• Secretary of the Corporation; Chief of Staff, Office of the President (non-voting) \\n• Vice President, Advancement (non-voting) \\nFaculty \\nThe University recognizes that it is important for the PAC to have wide-ranging input, \\nincluding from faculty of the university who are non-specialists in the field of art. In \\norder to ensure that the views of non-specialist faculty are represented, three faculty \\nmembers shall be appointed on a staggered basis by the deans of the Mellon College of \\nScience, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Institute of Technology, School of \\nComputer Science, College of Humanities and Social Sciences and Heinz School of Public \\nPolicy, according to the process set forth below. For the first year of appointments to the Committee: \\nDean \\nNo. of members appointed \\nTerm \\nMellon College of Science \\n1 \\n3 years \\nTepper School of Business  \\n1 \\n2 years \\nCarnegie Institute of Technology \\n1 \\n1 year \\n', \"214 \\n \\n \\n \\nFor the second year of appointments to the Committee: \\nDean \\nNo. of members appointed \\nTerm \\nSchool of Computer Science         \\n1 \\n3 years \\n \\nFor the third year of appointments to the Committee: \\nDean \\nNo. of members appointed \\nTerm \\nDietrich College  \\n1 \\n3 years \\n \\nFor the fourth year of appointments to the Committee, and for every year thereafter, \\none dean shall appoint one member of his or her school's or college's faculty for a three \\nyear term in the following order:  The Heinz School of Public Policy (Year 4), Mellon \\nCollege of Science (Year 5), Tepper School of Business (Year 6), Carnegie Institute of \\nTechnology (Year 7), School of Computer Science (Year 8) and College of Humanities and \\nSocial Sciences (Year 9) and so on and so forth such that at all times the Committee shall \\nhave three members who are faculty of the aforementioned schools and colleges. The \\nunexpired term of any vacancy created by the resignation or death of any member shall \\nbe filled by the dean that appointed the original member. Trustees \\nTwo trustees, designated by the chair of the Property & Facilities Committee of the \\nBoard of Trustees, appointed for terms of two years each. Students \\nTwo undergraduate students selected by the Student Senate and two graduate students \\nselected by the Graduate Student Assembly, appointed for terms of one year each. Staff \\nOne staff member selected by the Staff Council, appointed for a term of two years. External Community \\nOne member, designated by the provost in consultation with the chair of the PAC and \\nthe Property & Facilities Committee of the Board of Trustees (e.g. a prominent \\n\", '215 \\n \\n \\nalumnus/a, a Pittsburgh-based museum director, or the head of a regional arts \\norganization), appointed for a term of two years. The PAC membership also shall include at least one member of the Design Review \\nCommittee (who can be one of the individuals named above) and the Artistic Properties \\nCommittee (who shall be the university librarian serving as the university archivist or \\nother librarian designated by him/her). The PAC may call on others in the campus \\ncommunity or outside consultants for their technical expertise as approved by the \\nProvost. Criteria for Acceptance/Rejection of Public Art \\nThe PAC will use the following criteria in considering gifts or purchases of public art: \\n• Proposed art shall display a high level of artistic quality and craftsmanship that \\nsupports and enhances the academic and creative missions of Carnegie Mellon. Distinctive works of art chosen or created for campus public space shall be of \\nsufficiently high quality to merit inclusion into Carnegie Mellon\\'s permanent collection. • The \"message\" of proposed art, if any, shall be acceptable to current standards and \\npolicies of the Carnegie Mellon community. • An appropriate site in campus public space shall be available. • Proposed art shall be structurally sound and present no environmental or safety \\nhazard. • An external funding source to cover all costs of acquisition, purchase, shipping, \\ninstallation, wall-to-wall insurance, appraisal, and maintenance shall be determined \\nprior to acceptance. If sufficient funding is not immediately available, this criterion may \\nbe waived in exceptional circumstances by the president. • The donor\\'s clear title to donated art and authenticity of the work shall be confirmed \\nprior to acceptance. Ownership and Deaccessioning \\nOwnership and acquisition terms will be determined by the standard gift agreement \\nbetween the university and the donor of public art. The university, with the approval of \\nthe PAC, reserves the right to sell or donate works of public art. ', '216 \\n \\n \\nCriteria for Deaccessioning \\nThe PAC may consider the deaccessioning of artwork for one or more of the following \\nreasons in the event that it cannot be resited: \\n1. A work is not, or is only rarely, on display because of lack of a suitable site.', '2. The condition or security of the artwork cannot be reasonably guaranteed. 3. The artwork has been damaged or has deteriorated and repair is impractical or \\nunfeasible. 4. The artwork endangers public safety. 5. In the case of site specific artwork, the artwork’s relationship to the site is altered \\nbecause of changes to the site. 6. The artwork has been determined to be incompatible within the context of the \\ncollection. 7. The university, with the concurrence of the PAC, wishes to replace the artwork with \\nwork of more significance by the same artist. 8. The artwork requires excessive maintenance or has faults of design or workmanship. Publications \\nPublications produced independently by students must clearly state that they do not carry \\nthe endorsement of Carnegie Mellon University. All university-sanctioned student \\npublications must be approved by the Office of the Dean of Students, and they should \\ninclude the official CMU wordmark and Statement of Assurance. Visit the brand guidelines for \\nmore information. Recycling Policy \\nThis is to announce the adoption of the following Recycling Policy for the university. Carnegie Mellon University is committed to recycling the materials it uses and to minimizing \\nnon-hazardous waste. It is the responsibility of every member of the campus community to \\nsupport these efforts that will protect our environment by conserving resources and \\npreserving rapidly diminishing landfill space. The implementation of a campus-wide recycling \\nprogram is the first step toward developing a comprehensive environmental policy for \\nCarnegie Mellon. Recycling is just one part of a much larger program of activities through \\nwhich Carnegie Mellon will take an increasingly active role to further understanding and \\npreservation of our environment in the years to come. ', \"217 \\n \\n \\nFacilities Management Services is responsible for the implementation of Carnegie Mellon's \\nrecycling program. The Environmental Coordinator in this department will be responsible for \\nthe management of the recycling program and coordination of waste reduction efforts on \\ncampus. Each department will designate, in writing, an official Recycling Liaison who will \\ncoordinate departmental recycling efforts with the Carnegie Mellon Environmental \\nCoordinator. The entire campus community is expected to actively participate in Carnegie Mellon's \\nRecycling Program and waste reduction efforts. This involves three distinct activities. 1. Recycling of paper, cardboard and beverage cans (aluminum and bimetal). 2. Source Reduction: This includes but is not limited to making double-sided copies, \\nincreased use of electronic mail instead of memos, reuse/resale of surplus furniture, etc. 3. Purchasing products made from recycled materials. The long-term success of recycling \\nprograms in this country depends on the creation of markets for recycled materials. All \\ndepartments should purchase recycled products wherever economically feasible. Recycling programs already functioning on campus are encouraged to continue and expand \\nprovided that they do not hinder the campus-wide recycling program. Individuals responsible \\nfor such programs must provide recycling volume data to the Carnegie Mellon University \\nEnvironmental Coordinator to permit the university to comply with Pennsylvania Act 101 \\n(Pennsylvania Municipal Waste Planning, Recycling and Waste Reduction Act 101 of 1988). Safety Intervention Protocol \\nCarnegie Mellon is committed to maintaining a safe and secure environment for students, \\nfaculty, staff and visitors and may intervene in circumstances that seriously affect the health \\nor well-being of any student, where physical safety is seriously threatened, or where the \\noperations of the university are seriously disrupted. In keeping with this commitment, this \\nprotocol describes the procedures for assessing potential risk presented by students and \\ninterventions the university may enact. If safety is an immediate concern, an associate vice president of student affairs (or their \\ndesignee), may determine the need to issue a mandate that: \\n1. specifies the conditions for a student to maintain (or resume) her/his status as an enrolled \\nstudent; and/or: \\n2. requires a student to absent herself/himself from campus until specified conditions have \\nbeen satisfactorily engaged or completed. \", '218 \\n \\n \\nAny and all conditions of a mandate will be specified in a written letter from the associate \\nvice president of student affairs to the student. Such conditions may include: \\n• A behavioral contract; \\n• A no contact agreement/order; \\n• Transferring rooms within university housing; \\n• Removal from university housing; \\n• Completion of a pending community standards proceeding and/or investigation by the \\nOffice for Institutional Equity and Title IX; \\n• Engagement in an appropriate care or treatment plan; \\n• Temporary withdrawal from the university; \\n• Signed releases of information or communication with support sources such as parents or \\ntreatment providers; and/or \\n• Other conditions deemed reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. A mandate will only be issued when, in the professional judgment of an associate vice \\npresident of student affairs (or their designee), after considering all reasonably available \\ninformation, it is determined that the student: \\n• Poses a credible substantial risk of harm to individuals within the University or to the \\nUniversity community as a whole; or \\n• Substantially impedes the lawful activities, the educational process, or the proper \\nactivities or functions of members of the University community. The decision to issue a mandate will be predicated on an individualized assessment of the \\nstudent’s behaviors. The primary considerations in making this assessment will be the \\nseverity of the safety risk presented by the student, the impact of the student’s behaviors on \\nthe university community and the broader community, the student’s willingness or \\nunwillingness to voluntarily engage in a level of care that is clinically indicated; and whether \\nreasonable modifications of the university’s polices, practices or procedures significantly \\nmitigate the risk. Should a mandate be deemed appropriate, the university will identify the \\nstudent affairs staff member(s) who will support and assist the student in meeting specific \\nrequirements and associated timelines for completion, which will be outlined in writing by \\nthe associate vice president of student affairs. If necessary, the student may be placed on an \\nadministrative leave of absence while completing these requirements. ', '219 \\n \\n \\nA student who receives a mandate under this protocol may appeal the decision in writing to \\nthe dean of students. In connection with an appeal, a student may submit whatever \\nadditional evidence the student believes may be relevant to the decision. Safety Hazards \\nThe occupation, alteration, or use of university facilities that creates a fire or safety hazard \\n(potential or actual), creates danger to individuals or others, or creates a threat to university \\nproperty is a violation of university regulations and the individual responsible is subject to \\nappropriate disciplinary action. No use of explosive or incendiary materials on university property in connection with \\nprograms or activities may take place without the explicit permission of the dean of students \\nand the director of environmental health and safety or their designated representatives. Failure to abide by this regulation will result in suspension of social and competitive \\nprivileges of the organization and/or individual violating the regulation. Scheduling of University Facilities \\nScheduling of Space \\nAny Student Senate recognized organization is entitled to reserve available meeting space \\non the campus without rental fee. Charges for special services may be made if deemed \\nnecessary. Any student organization holding a function, dance, or social event in the \\nCohon University Center with 100 or more people in attendance must employ a campus \\npolice officer for the event. If there are more than 200 people in attendance two officers \\nmust be present. The following procedures should be followed in making requests for \\nspace and special services: \\n1. Requests for space should be made through the online space request system \\nthrough the Cohon University Center. 2. Arrangements for food service should be made by calling Dining Services at 412-268-\\n2129 or email. 3. Arrangements for media technology needs should be made by calling 412-268-8855 \\nor email. ', '220 \\n \\n \\nRules Governing Rental of Space by Non-University Organization \\nA non-university organization is one in which the membership and leadership consist \\nprimarily of individuals who are not members of the Carnegie Mellon community. The \\nmere presence of Carnegie Mellon students and/or faculty in the general membership or \\neven in positions of leadership of an organization does not make it a university \\norganization, nor does the fact that the request for facilities is made either by a faculty \\nmember or a student. Where student organizations “sponsor” non-university \\norganizations as defined above, the request will be treated as if the non-university \\norganization itself had made the request. Non-university organizations may be allowed to use Carnegie Mellon facilities under the \\nfollowing conditions: \\n1. They are organized primarily for professional or educational purposes. 2. The request for facilities is submitted in writing at least 30 days prior to the event. 3. The presence of the function on campus will not interfere with the normal activities \\nof the university. 4. Where there is a question in the mind of the authorizing officer about the \\nappropriateness of the request, it will be referred immediately to the dean of \\nstudents and the appropriate campus administrators. 5. When a university group requests facilities for a meeting at which substantial off-\\ncampus attendance would be expected and notice of the meeting would be \\ndisseminated beyond the campus, the request must be reviewed with the dean of \\nstudents and the appropriate campus administrators. 6. If an event is to be approved that will substantially reduce the facilities available for \\nstudent use during periods when students are in residence, the request will be \\ndiscussed with the Student Government before final approval is given. 7. All requests for the use of Carnegie Mellon facilities by non-university organizations \\nshall be made originally with the Office of Conference and Event Services at 412-268-\\n1125 or via email. Permission to use facilities may not be assumed until a room \\nreservation form has been signed by the Office of Conference and Event Services or \\nthe dean of students. ', '221 \\n \\n \\nSexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) \\nI. Policy Statement \\nThe mission of Carnegie Mellon University is to cultivate a transformative educational \\nexperience for its students that is committed to promoting and safeguarding their \\npersonal health and well-being. In addition, the mission is to create a collaborative \\nenvironment open to the free exchange of ideas, where research, creativity, innovation, \\nand entrepreneurship can flourish and where individuals can achieve their full potential. It \\nis the policy of Carnegie Mellon University to maintain an academic and work \\nenvironment that promotes the confidence to work, study, innovate and perform without \\nfear of sexual misconduct. Such misconduct diminishes individual dignity, is contrary to \\nthe values of the university and is a barrier to fulfilling the university’s mission. It will not \\nbe tolerated at Carnegie Mellon University. It is the responsibility of every member of the University Community to foster an \\nenvironment free of sexual misconduct. All members of the University Community are \\nencouraged to take reasonable and prudent actions to prevent or stop such behavior. The Interim Sexual Misconduct Policy (“Policy”) prohibits the types of misconduct listed \\nbelow and defined in Section IX (also referred to collectively as “Prohibited Conduct”): \\n• \\nSexual Assault; \\n• \\nSexual Exploitation; \\n• \\nSexual Harassment; \\n• \\nStalking; \\n• \\nDating Violence; \\n• \\nDomestic Violence; \\n• \\nRetaliation; and \\n• \\nViolation of Protective Measures. This Policy is intended to: (1) prevent, eliminate and remedy the effects of Prohibited \\nConduct; (2) foster an environment where all individuals are well-informed and supported \\nin reporting Prohibited Conduct; and (3) provide a prompt, fair and impartial process for \\nall parties once the university is made aware of possible Prohibited Conduct. While these \\nprinciples are clear and straightforward, the detailed procedures set forth in this Policy \\nare necessary to assure that these matters are handled in an impartial, thoughtful and \\n', '222 \\n \\n \\nthorough manner, consistent with the university’s dedication to the integrity of its \\nprocess. Furthermore, on May 19, 2020, the Department of Education issued a Final Rule under \\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 with an effective date of August 14, 2020. The Final Rule governs how certain acts of sexual misconduct are defined under Title IX \\nand sets forth the procedures and other requirements for adjudicating claims of such \\nconduct (the “Final Rule”). For purposes of this Policy, the conduct described in the Final \\nRule shall be referred to as “Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct.” Federal Rule Sexual \\nMisconduct is defined as follows: \\n• \\nFederal Rule Sexual Misconduct — A subset of Prohibited Conduct that rises to a level \\nof severity and pervasiveness such that it is prohibited expressly by the Final \\nRule. Prohibited Conduct meets the definition of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct \\nwhen:  \\no A Faculty member or Staff member conditions the provision of an aid, a benefit, \\nor a service on another Faculty member, Staff member, Student, or third party’s \\nparticipation in unwelcome sexual conduct (commonly known as Quid Pro Quo); \\no A Faculty member, Staff member, Student or third party engages in unwelcome \\nconduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive \\nthat it effectively denies another person equal access to the University’s Programs \\nor Activities (commonly known as Sexual Harassment); or \\no A Faculty member, Staff member, Student or third party engages in Sexual \\nAssault, Dating Violence, Domestic Violence or Stalking. • \\nAlleged conduct is Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct (though it may still be Prohibited \\nConduct) only if: \\no The alleged conduct was perpetrated against a person in the United States; and \\no The conduct took place within the University’s Programs or Activities. • \\nConduct that does not meet this strict definition for Federal Rule Sexual \\nMisconduct is still prohibited by this Policy if it otherwise constitutes Prohibited \\nConduct (also referred to as “Other Prohibited Conduct”). Faculty, Staff, Students, or third parties who violate this Policy may face, as appropriate, \\ndisciplinary action up to and including termination, expulsion, or other actions. ', \"223 \\n \\n \\nNothing in this Policy shall be construed to abridge the free expression of ideas that is \\nessential to the university’s mission. The discourse conducted in accordance with the \\nuniversity's Freedom of Expression Policy and with the statement on Academic Freedom \\nand Responsibility enunciated in the Appointment and Tenure Policy, whether in written, \\nspoken, or electronic forms, shall be consistent with this Policy. This Policy is intended to meet the university’s obligations under Title VII of the Civil Rights \\nAct of 1964 (“Title VII”); Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”); the \\nJeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (“Clery \\nAct”), as amended by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (“VAWA”), \\nwith respect to its application to sexual misconduct; and other applicable law and \\nregulations. II. Jurisdiction \\nThis Policy applies to Faculty, Staff, Students, and third parties. This Policy covers acts of \\nProhibited Conduct committed by or against Students, Faculty, Staff, and third parties \\nwhen the Prohibited Conduct occurs: \\n• \\nIn a University Program or Activity, including, but not limited to,  \\no conduct that occurs on a university campus or other property owned or \\ncontrolled by the university; \\no in the context of university employment; or \\no in the context of university-sponsored study abroad, research, field work, practice, \\nor internship programs; or \\n• \\nOutside of a University Program or Activity,  \\no but poses a serious threat of harm, \\no has a continuing adverse effect on, or impedes equal access to educational \\nprograms or activities, or \\no creates a hostile environment for Students, Faculty, Staff, or third parties. The university retains discretion to determine whether out-of-program conduct is within \\nits jurisdiction. In making this determination, including off-campus or online conduct that \\nis not part of a University Program or Activity, the university will consider the severity of \\nthe alleged conduct, the risk of ongoing harm, whether both parties are members of the \\nUniversity Community, impact on University Programs or Activities, and whether off-\\ncampus conduct is part of a series of actions that occurred both on and off campus. \", '224 \\n \\n \\nThis Policy supersedes any conflicting information in any other university policies with \\nrespect to the definitions or procedures relating to Prohibited Conduct. III. Prohibited Conduct \\nProhibited Conduct under this Policy includes the following specifically defined forms of \\nbehavior: Sexual Assault, Sexual Exploitation, Sexual Harassment, Stalking, Dating \\nViolence, Domestic Violence, Retaliation, and Violation of Protective Measures. Whether \\nsomeone has engaged in Prohibited Conduct under this Policy will be assessed under a \\nReasonable Person standard. Some Prohibited Conduct, like certain sex based crimes, unwelcome conduct that is \\nsufficiently severe and pervasive, and conduct that conditions an aid or benefit on \\nunwelcome sexual activity, may also constitute Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct. Some forms of conduct which may be considered inappropriate or unacceptable within \\nthe Carnegie Mellon community, such as incivility or bullying, may not meet the definition \\nof Prohibited Conduct under this Policy. However, the university retains discretion to \\nreport the conduct to an internal university department or authority such as Human \\nResources, Office of Community Standards and Integrity, or relevant academic \\ndepartment or dean to determine and implement appropriate responsive action, \\nincluding review for possible misconduct under other university policies. IV. Reporting \\nThe university strives to create an environment where all members of the Carnegie Mellon \\ncommunity are aware of options for informing the university about instances of \\nsuspected Prohibited Conduct, how to seek assistance and support, and how to pursue \\nuniversity action for their own protection and that of the entire campus community. This \\nPolicy distinguishes the action of reporting from filing a Formal Complaint. Thus, \\ninformation shared about suspected Prohibited Conduct does not automatically trigger \\nformal action or an investigation, as discussed below in Section VI.B. This section outlines \\nthe mechanisms for reporting and how the university will respond to information it \\nreceives. Some forms of Prohibited Conduct may also constitute crimes. The university also \\nstrongly encourages any individual who experiences, witnesses, or learns of possible \\ncriminal conduct to report them to the University Police Department or local law \\nenforcement. Prompt reporting allows law enforcement to collect and preserve evidence. • To report in person:  \\n', '225 \\n \\n \\no Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX/Title IX Coordinator \\n4615 Forbes Avenue, \\nSuite 330 \\nPittsburgh, PA 15213 \\n• To report by phone or email: \\no Please call 412-268-7125 or email institutionalequity@cmu.edu \\n• To report online, including anonymously: \\no Please go to cmu.ethicspoint.com or call 844-587-0793 \\n• To report possible criminal conduct: \\no University Police Department \\n300 South Craig Street \\nPittsburgh, PA 15213 \\n412-268-2323 \\ncampuspd@andrew.cmu.edu \\nThe university maintains a Resource Guide for individuals who file reports of Prohibited \\nConduct that provides information for community members about filing reports \\nof Prohibited Conduct through the university’s policies, support resources, community \\nresources, and how to support a friend or family member who has been impacted by such \\nconduct. Individuals who report Prohibited Conduct in Pennsylvania will also be informed \\nof their rights as a victim of a crime under Pennsylvania law. A. How to Make a Report \\nAny individual, including Complainants, Students, Faculty, Staff, or third parties are \\nencouraged to submit reports of suspected Prohibited Conduct directly to the Office for \\nInstitutional Equity and Title IX in-person, via email, phone call, or online. Reports can also be \\nmade to the university officials listed in Section VIII who are designated with the authority to \\ninstitute corrective measures. The university encourages all members of the Carnegie Mellon community to report to the \\nTitle IX Coordinator any information they learn about Prohibited Conduct. Sharing \\ninformation of concern enables the university to offer support to impacted parties and \\nprotects the community from continuance of the alleged misconduct. Third parties should \\nnote that a report about possible Prohibited Conduct, including Federal Rule Sexual \\nMisconduct, does not alone trigger a formal resolution process. Instead, as further explained \\n', '226 \\n \\n \\nin Section VI.A, a Formal Complaint must be filed in order for the formal investigation and \\nresolution process to commence. Certain employees identified as Responsible Employees must report information to the Title \\nIX Coordinator so that the university can offer support and resolution options to the \\nComplainant. These individuals are listed in Section VIII along with additional information \\nregarding their obligations. Upon receipt of a report, the university will promptly contact the Complainant to discuss \\nappropriate Supportive Measures (see Section V.A) and to explain the process for filing \\na Formal Complaint (see Section VI.A). Complainants are not obligated to respond to \\noutreach from the university and the university will respect this decision, with limited \\nexceptions where it is obligated by law or to act in the safety interest of the community. B. Anonymous Reporting \\nAn individual who is not a Responsible Employee may make a report of Prohibited Conduct to \\nthe Title IX Coordinator, and if preferred, may do so without disclosing one’s name using the \\nonline reporting form listed above and here: \\n• cmu.ethicspoint.com \\nDepending on the level of information available about the incident or the individuals \\ninvolved, the university’s ability to respond to an anonymous report may be limited. The \\nuniversity will, however, take whatever steps it deems appropriate and in the best interests \\nof the overall University Community, consistent with the information available. The university \\nwill never refuse to respond a report solely on the grounds that it was made anonymously. Information collected through the anonymous reporting line will be shared only with \\nnecessary university officials in order to respond to the reported concern. Information is kept \\nconfidential and no personally identifiable information is shared, except as necessary to \\nfollow this Policy, without the party’s consent. C. Reports to Law Enforcement \\nAn individual who experiences, witnesses, or learns of possible criminal conduct may contact \\nlaw enforcement directly by calling: \\n• 911 (for emergencies off-campus) \\n• University Police Department \\n300 South Craig Street \\nPittsburgh, PA 15213 \\n', '227 \\n \\n \\n(412) 268-2323 (for emergencies on-campus) \\ncampuspd@andrew.cmu.edu \\nV. How the University Responds to Reports \\nA.', 'Supportive Measures \\nThe university is committed to helping Complainants continue their education and \\nemployment after experiencing Prohibited Conduct. Regardless of whether a person \\nchooses to pursue an investigation, alternative resolution, a formal resolution, or chooses \\nnot to pursue any further process, the Title IX Coordinator or a designated university \\nofficial conducts an initial assessment to determine next steps and will initiate contact to \\ndiscuss the availability of Supportive Measures. Supportive Measures are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services, \\naccommodations, and other assistance that the university offers and may put in place, \\nwithout fee or charge, after receiving notice of possible Prohibited Conduct. Supportive \\nMeasures are designed to restore or preserve access to the University’s Programs and \\nActivities, protect the safety of all parties and the university’s educational environment, or \\ndeter Prohibited Conduct, while not being punitive in nature or unreasonably burdening \\neither party. Supportive Measures are available regardless of whether the matter is reported to the \\nuniversity for the purpose of initiating a formal resolution under this Policy and before, \\nafter, and regardless of whether a Formal Complaint is filed. A Complainant who requests \\nSupportive Measures retains the right to file a Formal Complaint, either at the time the \\nSupportive Measure is offered or requested or at a later date. Any Complainant that \\nrequests Supportive Measures will be informed in writing of their right to simultaneously \\nor subsequently file a Formal Complaint pursuant to this Policy. Upon receipt of a report, the Title IX Coordinator, or their designee, will contact \\nthe Complainant (1) to discuss the availability of Supportive Measures and (2) to explain \\nthat Supportive Measures are available with or without the filing of a Formal Complaint. The Title IX Case Manager helps determine the appropriate Supportive Measure(s) to be \\nimplemented. The Title IX Case Manager will assess with the Complainant the unique facts \\nand circumstances of their situation and identify steps to help the individual meet their \\neducational or employment expectations. The Title IX Coordinator, or their designee, will \\nserve as the point of contact for implementing any identified measures to ensure the \\nburden of implementation does not fall on the recipient of the Supportive Measures. ', \"228 \\n \\n \\nSupportive Measures will not be disciplinary or punitive in nature and will not \\nunreasonably burden, or unreasonably interfere with the educational pursuits of, either \\nparty. Whether a possible Supportive Measure would unreasonably burden either party is \\na fact-specific determination that takes into account the nature of the educational \\nprograms, activities, opportunities and benefits in which an individual is participating. Supportive Measures may also be requested by and made equally available \\nto Respondents, witnesses, and other impacted members of the University Community. Examples of Supportive Measures include: \\n• Academic support services and accommodations, including the ability to reschedule \\nclasses, exams and assignments, transfer course sections, or withdraw from courses; \\n• Academic schedule modifications (typically to separate Complainant and Respondent); \\n• Work schedule or job assignment modifications (for university employment); \\n• Changes in on-campus work or university housing location; \\n• On-campus counseling services and/or assistance in connecting to community-based \\ncounseling services; \\n• Assistance in connecting to community-based medical services; \\n• No contact agreements (agreements between parties to stop all attempts at \\ncommunication or other interaction with one another); \\n• Temporarily limiting an individual's access to certain university facilities or activities; \\n• Work schedule or job assignment modifications; \\n• Information about and/or assistance with obtaining personal protection orders; \\n• Leaves of absences; \\n• Increased monitoring and security of certain areas of the campus; \\n• Individualized limitations on the parties’ communications and interactions with each \\nother; or \\n• A combination of any of these measures. The university will maintain Supportive Measures provided to \\nthe Complainant or Respondent as confidential to the extent that maintaining such \\nconfidentiality would not impair the university’s ability to provide the Supportive \\nMeasures. \", \"229 \\n \\n \\nB. Support and Resources \\nAll members of the Carnegie Mellon community may seek support and access resources \\non and off-campus that are available at no cost. The Office for Institutional Equity and \\nTitle IX can assist individuals in accessing these resources or individuals may contact the \\ndepartments or organizations directly. Some of these resources are designated as confidential. Other resources provide support, \\nbut may need to involve the Title IX Coordinator and/or the University Police Department. Regardless of whether the university determines that Prohibited Conduct occurred, the \\nuniversity will offer resources or assistance to Complainants, Respondents, witnesses, and \\nother impacted community members after receiving notice of alleged Prohibited Conduct. The university will also assist those individuals in identifying and contacting external law \\nenforcement agencies and community resources, when desired by the individual. 1. Confidential Resources \\nCarnegie Mellon understands that some individuals impacted by Prohibited Conduct, \\nparticularly conduct involving sexual violence, may not be ready or may not be willing \\nto report through a channel that may lead to an investigation or other university \\naction, no matter how discreet. For such individuals, Carnegie Mellon maintains several \\nconfidential reporting options. These resources can provide individuals with assistance, support, and additional \\ninformation. Confidential Resources are prohibited from disclosing confidential \\ninformation unless (1) given permission by the person who disclosed the information; \\n(2) there is an imminent threat of harm to self or others; (3) the conduct involves \\nsuspected abuse of a minor under the age of 18; or (4) as otherwise required or \\npermitted by law or court order. Confidential Resources may be required to report \\nnon-identifying information to CMUPD for crime reporting purposes. 2. Campus Resources \\no Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) (Student only) \\n412-268-2922  \\no University Health Services (Student only) \\n412-268-2157 \\no Employee Assistance Program (Employees only) \\n3. Community Resources \\no Women's Shelter and Center of Greater Pittsburgh \\n\", '230 \\n \\n \\no Pittsburgh Action Against Rape \\no Center for Victims \\no Persad \\nVI. How a Complaint is Resolved \\nA. Filing a Formal Complaint \\nA Complainant who chooses to pursue an alternative or formal resolution to address any \\nreported Prohibited Conduct must begin by filing a Formal Complaint with the Office for \\nInstitutional Equity and Title IX. Filing a Formal Complaint will initiate an investigation \\npursuant to the university’s process outlined in Section VI.B below. The university will not \\ncommence a formal investigation or its resolution process without the Complainant or the \\nTitle IX Coordinator filing a Formal Complaint. A Complainant may file a Formal Complaint with the Title IX Coordinator in person, by mail, \\nor by email with submission of a Formal Complaint Form. The Formal Complaint must \\ncontain the Complainant’s physical or digital signature or otherwise indicate that \\nthe Complainant is the person filing (if the Complainant is under the age of 18 and not \\nenrolled in an undergraduate or graduate program, the University will ordinarily also contact \\nthe Complainant’s parent or guardian, as permitted by law, to explain the process for filing \\na Formal Complaint). A Complainant may file a Formal Complaint at any time, but significant \\ndelays between the time an incident occurs and conducting an investigation may impede or \\nlimit the availability of relevant material and/or availability of witnesses. In certain circumstances, the Title IX Coordinator may file a Formal Complaint. Whether \\nthe university will begin an investigation in response to a report under these \\ncircumstances depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to the wishes of \\nthe Complainant, the nature and scope of the alleged Prohibited Conduct, the risk posed \\nto any individual or to the campus community by not proceeding, and/or the University’s \\ndetermination about whether its legal obligations compel it to pursue the resolution of a \\nreport. After a Formal Complaint has been filed, or signed by the Title IX Coordinator, the \\nuniversity will commence its investigation and resolution process. In order for the \\nallegations set forth in a Formal Complaint to constitute Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct, \\nat the time of filing a Formal Complaint, the Complainant must be participating in or \\nattempting to participate in the University’s Programs or Activities. If the Complainant is \\nnot participating in or attempting to participate in the University’s Programs or \\nActivities at the time the Formal Complaint is filed, the Title IX Coordinator will review \\n', '231 \\n \\n \\nthe Formal Complaint and determine whether to initiate an investigation of Other \\nProhibited Conduct, as specified in Section VI.B below. B. Investigation Procedures \\nUpon the filing of a Formal Complaint, the Title IX Coordinator (or designee) will review \\nthe Formal Complaint to determine whether the allegations, if true, would constitute Federal \\nRule Sexual Misconduct. If the Title IX Coordinator determines that the allegations in \\nthe Formal Complaint, if true, would constitute Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct, the Title IX \\nCoordinator must commence an investigation as set forth below. If the Title IX Coordinator determines that the allegations in the Formal Complaint, if true, \\nwould not constitute Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct but would constitute Other Prohibited \\nConduct, the Title IX Coordinator will review the Formal Complaint to determine whether the \\nallegations, if true, significantly impact the University Community, represent a potential \\nthreat to members of the University Community, or have some other significant connection \\nto the University Community. Based on this review, the Title IX Coordinator will have \\ndiscretion to commence an investigation as set forth below. Throughout the investigation and adjudication of the Formal Complaint, both the \\nComplainant and the Respondent may select an Advisor of their choice. Details \\nconcerning the role of the Advisor are set forth in the applicable adjudication procedures \\nunder Section VI.C and Section VI.E of this Policy. The role of an Advisor in any hearing \\nmay vary based on the applicable adjudication procedures. After deciding to commence an investigation, the Title IX Coordinator will appoint an \\ninvestigator to review, assess and investigate the Formal Complaint (the “Investigator”). The Investigator may be a staff member in the Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX, a \\nstaff member in Human Resources, a staff member in another department at the \\nuniversity, or an external professional. The Title IX Coordinator is responsible for ensuring \\nthat the Investigator has been appropriately trained and is free of conflicts of interest or \\nbias that would impair the investigation. The Title IX Coordinator will send the Complainant, Respondent and their \\nrespective Advisors a written notice of investigation. The Investigator will conduct an \\ninvestigation and prepare a preliminary investigative report that fairly summarizes the \\nrelevant evidence gathered during the investigation. Prior to preparing any report the \\nInvestigator will request relevant information from the parties as well as work to gather \\nother relevant available evidence. Although the ultimate responsibility for gathering \\navailable evidence rests with the University, the University is unable to compel any person \\nto participate in its grievance process. The university cannot access, consider, disclose, or \\n', \"232 \\n \\n \\notherwise use a party's records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, \\npsychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the \\nprofessional's or paraprofessional's capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are \\nmade and maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the party, unless \\nthe university obtains that party's voluntary, written consent. Throughout the \\ninvestigation the university will provide both parties equal opportunity for the parties to \\npresent witnesses, including fact and expert witnesses, and other inculpatory and \\nexculpatory evidence. The parties may offer testimony from an expert witness, as \\nspecified in Appendix B to this policy. The preliminary investigative report will be made \\navailable to the Complainant, Respondent and their respective Advisors in electronic or \\nhard-copy format. Any evidence collected during the investigation will also be made \\navailable to the Complainant, Respondent and their respective Advisors for inspection and \\nreview in electronic or hard-copy format. The Complainant and Respondent will have at \\nleast ten (10) business days to review and respond to the preliminary investigative report. The Investigator will consider any responses submitted by \\nthe Complainant, Respondent and their respective Advisors and prepare a final \\ninvestigative report (“Investigative Report”). The Title IX Coordinator will review the Investigative Report and all relevant evidence to \\ndetermine whether the allegations, if true, would constitute Federal Rule Sexual \\nMisconduct and/or Other Prohibited Conduct. Allegations that would constitute Federal \\nRule Sexual Misconduct will be adjudicated under Section VI.C regarding Adjudication \\nProcedures for Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct. Allegations that would constitute Other \\nProhibited Conduct will be adjudicated under Section VI.E regarding Adjudication \\nProcedures for Other Prohibited Misconduct. In cases involving multiple allegations which \\ninclude Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct and Other Prohibited Conduct, the university \\nreserves the right to decide whether to adjudicate all allegations in a single process under \\nthe Procedures for Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct or to separately adjudicate the \\nallegations under separate applicable procedures. When the university receives a report of alleged conduct that could constitute Prohibited \\nConduct other than Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct (i.e. Other Prohibited Conduct) under \\nthis Policy and could violate other university policies, the university, in its discretion, will \\ndetermine which policy/ies and procedures apply and whether action will be taken under \\nmultiple policies. With regard to Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct and Other Prohibited Conduct, in the \\nevent that at the time of a report or the conclusion of an investigation it becomes \\napparent that the alleged conduct, if true, would not constitute Federal Rule Sexual \\n\", '233 \\n \\n \\nMisconduct or Other Prohibited Conduct as defined in this Policy, the matter may be \\nadjudicated under another applicable policy or procedure at the university’s discretion. For any allegation of Prohibited Conduct that allegedly occurred before the effective date \\nof this Policy, the university will use the sexual harassment and/or sexual assault policy \\nthat was in effect at the time the Prohibited Conduct allegedly occurred for the purpose of \\ndefining conduct that constitutes a violation of policy. However the matter will be \\ninvestigated and adjudicated using the current procedures as set forth in Section VI of this \\nPolicy. Complaints where all of the alleged Prohibited Conduct occurred before the \\neffective date of this Policy will be adjudicated using the procedures for Other Prohibited \\nConduct set forth in Section VI.E of this Policy. C. Adjudication Procedures for Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct \\nAppointment of Hearing Officer \\nAfter reviewing the Investigative Report prepared under Section VI.B above, if the Title IX \\nCoordinator determines that the allegations, if true, would constitute Federal Rule Sexual \\nMisconduct, the university will conduct a formal hearing. The Title IX Coordinator will appoint \\na hearing officer (“Hearing Officer”) who will be responsible for presiding over a live hearing \\nand making findings of fact and a determination of responsibility with respect to each \\nallegation in the Formal Complaint. The Title IX Coordinator and/or Investigator are not \\neligible to serve as the Hearing Officer. Conduct of the Hearing & Written Determination \\nThe Hearing Officer will conduct a live hearing in accordance with the Hearing Procedures for \\nthe Adjudication of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct [pdf]. The hearing will take place no \\nsooner than ten days after the parties are provided with the Investigative Report. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer will make findings of fact and a \\ndetermination of responsibility with respect to each allegation. The determination of \\nresponsibility will be made using the preponderance of evidence standard. If the Hearing Officer determines that the Respondent is responsible for any allegation, \\nthe Hearing Officer will contact the appropriate sanctioning officer, as specified below, to \\nreview the findings of findings of fact and determination(s) regarding responsibility \\n(“Sanctioning Officer”). The Sanctioning Officer will have sole responsibility for \\ndetermining the appropriate sanctions and remedies related to any finding of \\nresponsibility made by the Hearing Officer. The Sanctioning Officer will provide a written \\ndetermination regarding sanctions to the Hearing Officer. If the Hearing Officer \\n', '234 \\n \\n \\ndetermines that the Respondent is not responsible for any of the allegations, the \\nSanctioning Officer will not be contacted. The applicable Sanctioning Officer is based on the nature of the Respondent’s relationship \\nto the university: \\n• Sanctioning Officer for Students: Associate Vice President of Student Affairs for \\nCommunity Life or designee \\n• Sanctioning Officer for Staff: Associate Vice President & Chief Human Resources Officer \\nor designee \\n• Sanctioning Officer for Faculty: Provost or designee \\nThe Hearing Officer will prepare a written determination regarding the findings of fact and \\nthe determination regarding responsibility for each allegation. Where applicable, the \\nwritten decision of the Sanctioning Officer regarding sanctions and remedies will be \\nattached to or incorporated into the written determination prepared by the Hearing \\nOfficer. The required content of the written determination of the Hearing Officer is set \\nforth in the Hearing Procedures for the Adjudication of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct \\n[pdf]. Notice of Written Determination \\nThe written determination will be provided to the Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX \\nCoordinator or designee is responsible for providing the Complainant and Respondent with a \\ncopy of the written determination. Both parties must be provided the written determination \\nsimultaneously. Additional Procedures for Sanctions Against Faculty Respondents \\nIn the case of sanctions against a Faculty Respondent, the sanctions determined by the \\nSanctioning Officer for Faculty will be provided to the President as recommended sanctions. The President will take no action on the recommended sanctions until either (i) the \\ncompletion of any appeal filed by any party under Section VI.D of this Policy or (ii) the \\ndeadline to file an appeal under Section VI.D of this Policy passes without any appeal being \\nfiled. If an appeal is filed, the President or the President’s designee will render a decision on \\nthe appeal consistent with the procedures in Section VI.D of this Policy. If any sanctions \\nremain after the completion of the appeal or where no appeal is filed by the appeal deadline, \\nthe President will thereafter render a decision based on both the recommendation of the \\nSanctioning Officer for Faculty as well as the underlying findings of fact and determination(s) \\nof responsibility by the Hearing Officer (or Appeal Officer, if applicable). If the President \\ndecides to initiate the procedure for dismissal for cause or for the imposition of another \\n', '235 \\n \\n \\nsanction against a Faculty Respondent, the matter will then follow the process set forth in the \\nsubsection \"Procedure\" of the section of the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie \\nMellon University titled, \"Dismissal for Cause and Other Sanctions\", but will be subject to the \\n\"Exceptions\" provision of that subsection such that no Ad-Hoc Committee will be required. D. Appeal Procedures for Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct \\nBoth the Complainant and Respondent have the right to file an appeal regarding (i) the \\ndetermination under Section VI.C of this Policy or (ii) the dismissal of a Formal Complaint \\nand/or determination that a Formal Complaint does not constitute Federal Rule Sexual \\nMisconduct. An appeal must be submitted in writing to the Office of the President (with a \\ncopy to the Title IX Coordinator) within seven (7) calendar days of the official notification \\nof the determination under Section VI.C. The written appeal request must state the basis \\nfor the appeal. The basis for an appeal will be limited to one or more of the following: \\n• Procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter; \\n• New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination \\nregarding responsibility or dismissal was made, that could affect the outcome of the \\nmatter; \\n• The Title IX Coordinator, Investigator(s), or Hearing Officer, or Sanctioning Officer had a \\nconflict of interest or bias for or against Complainants or Respondents generally or the \\nindividual Complainant or Respondent that affected the outcome of the matter; and \\n• The sanctions imposed are disproportionate to the finding of responsibility. The President or the President’s designee will serve as the Appeal Officer. The Appeal \\nOfficer will inform the other party or parties that an appeal has been filed and provide \\nsuch party or parties with a copy of the written appeal. The non-appealing party will have \\na reasonable, equal opportunity to submit a responsive written statement for \\nconsideration by the Appeal Officer. The Appeal Officer will review the written appeal and any response and determine \\nwhether, in the judgment of the Appeal Officer, sufficient grounds exist for at least one \\nbasis of appeal. An appeal that does not meet at least one of the acceptable bases for \\nappeal may be dismissed without further review. Appeals will be decided by the Appeal Officer in a timely manner as circumstances \\nwarrant. While an appeal is under review, the appeal officer will update the Respondent(s) \\nand Complainant(s) as necessary about the anticipated timeline. ', '236 \\n \\n \\nThe Appeal Officer has the authority to modify the decision as they deem appropriate for \\nresolution of the matter being appealed, which could entail (i) sending the matter back to \\nan Investigator, the Hearing Officer, or a new Hearing Officer, as necessary to remedy the \\nerror or (ii) a decrease or change to the nature of the sanction(s). The Appeal Officer may \\nalso remand the matter for a new live hearing under Section VI.C of this Policy. The Appeal Officer will issue a written decision describing the result of the appeal and the \\nrationale for the result. The Appeal Officer will provide the written decision \\nsimultaneously to both the Complainant and Respondent. The Title IX Coordinator will \\nalso receive a copy of the decision. E. Adjudication Procedures for Other Prohibited Conduct \\nThe specific procedures for adjudicating allegations of Prohibited Conduct that, if true, \\nwould not constitute Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct (i.e. Other Prohibited Conduct) are \\nbased upon the nature of the Respondent’s relationship to the university. • Where the Respondent is a Student — the matter will be handled in accordance with \\nthe university’s Student Community Standards Process, which is set forth in the \\nCommunity Standards section of The Word. Appeals will also be handled in accordance \\nwith the Student Community Standards Process. • Where the Respondent is a Staff member— the Title IX Coordinator will send the \\nInvestigative Report to the Assistant Vice President, People and Organization \\nEffectiveness, in Human Resources and the matter will be handled in accordance with \\nthe procedures set forth in the Staff Handbook, Volume II, Section 10c. • Where the Respondent is a Faculty member — the Title IX Coordinator will send the \\nInvestigative Report to the Provost who will appoint a Hearing Officer to adjudicate the \\nmatter. The Hearing Officer will conduct a live hearing using the Procedures for Other \\nProhibited Conduct [pdf]. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer will \\nprepare a written report regarding findings of fact and a determination of \\nresponsibility with respect to each allegation. The determination of responsibility will \\nbe made using the preponderance of evidence standard. The written report of the Hearing Officer will be provided to the Provost. If the report \\nof the Hearing Officer includes a determination that the Respondent is responsible for \\nany of the allegations, the Provost will make a recommendation to the President \\nregarding applicable sanctions and remedies. The report of the Hearing Officer and, if \\napplicable, the recommendation of the Provost regarding sanctions will be provided to \\nthe Complainant, the Respondent, and the Title IX Coordinator. ', '237 \\n \\n \\nThe Complainant and Respondent may appeal the decision of the Hearing Officer \\nand/or the sanctions recommended by the Provost to the President. An appeal must \\nbe submitted in writing to the Office of the President within seven (7) calendar days of \\nthe notification of the decision of the Hearing Officer to the Complainant and \\nRespondent. The basis for an appeal will be limited to one or more of the following: \\n• Procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter;  \\n• New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination \\nregarding responsibility or dismissal was made, that could affect the outcome of \\nthe matter;  \\n• The Title IX Coordinator, Investigator(s), or Hearing Officer, or Provost had a conflict \\nof interest or bias for or against Complainants or Respondents generally or the \\nindividual Complainant or Respondent that affected the outcome of the matter; \\nand \\n• The sanctions recommended by the Provost are disproportionate to the finding of \\nresponsibility. Appeals will be adjudicated by the President or the President’s designee. The President \\nor the President’s designee will issue a written decision describing the result of the \\nappeal and the rationale for the result. The appeal decision will be provided to the \\nComplainant, the Respondent, and the Title IX Coordinator. Where the Provost recommends sanctions against a Faculty member, the President \\nwill take no action on the recommended sanctions until either (i) the completion of any \\nappeal filed by any party (ii) the deadline to file an appeal passes without any appeal \\nbeing filed. If an appeal is filed, the President or the President’s designee will render a \\ndecision on the appeal and will issue a written decision describing the result of the \\nappeal and the rationale for the result. The appeal decision will be provided to the \\nFormal Complaint, the Respondent, and the Title IX Coordinator. If any sanctions remain after the completion of the appeal or where no appeal is filed \\nby the appeal deadline, the President will thereafter render a decision based on both \\nthe recommendation of the Provost as well as the underlying findings of fact and \\ndetermination(s) of responsibility. If the President decides to initiate the procedure for \\ndismissal for cause or for the imposition of another sanction against a Faculty \\nRespondent, the matter will then follow the process set forth in the subsection \\n\"Procedure\" of the section of the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon \\n', '238 \\n \\n \\nUniversity titled, \"Dismissal for Cause and Other Sanctions\", but will be subject to the \\n\"Exceptions\" provision of that subsection such that no Ad-Hoc Committee will be \\nrequired. • Where the Respondent has dual-status (e.g. more than one status as Faculty, Staff or \\nStudent) — the university has discretion to determine which process to use under \\nSection VI.E depending on the circumstances of the case. • Where the Respondent is a third party — The university’s ability to take appropriate \\ncorrective action against a third party will be determined by the nature of the third \\nparty’s relationship to the university. The Title IX Coordinator will determine the \\nappropriate manner of resolution in accordance with the university’s commitment to a \\nprompt and equitable process and consistent with state and federal law, regulations, \\nguidance, and this Policy. F. Possible Outcomes & Sanctions from Adjudication \\nPossible outcomes from a violation of this Policy range from educational outcomes to \\nseparation from the university. A detailed list of the possible remedies and sanctions is \\navailable in Appendix A to this Policy. G. Alternative Resolutions \\nThis Policy describes two procedures for the formal resolution of Prohibited Misconduct – \\na procedure for the adjudication of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct in Section VI.C and a \\nprocedure for Other Prohibited Conduct in Section VI.E. Separate from these formal \\nresolution procedures, the university offers several forms of alternative resolution \\n(“Alternative Resolution”) procedures that may be available on a voluntary basis to resolve \\na Formal Complaint under this Policy. Individuals interested in an Alternative Resolution should contact the Office for \\nInstitutional Equity and Title IX to discuss options. For information regarding the types of \\nAlternate Resolution procedures that may be available please see Office for Institutional \\nEquity and Title IX website. Either party may request to pursue an Alternative Resolution at any time after the filing of \\nthe Formal Complaint and before a finding of responsibility under Section VI.C or Section \\nVI.E. The Title IX Coordinator has discretion to determine whether the parties will be \\npermitted to pursue an Alternative Resolution. Alternative Resolutions are not available in \\ncases involving a Student Complainant and a Faculty or Staff Respondent. In general, \\n', '239 \\n \\n \\nmediation and other Alternative Resolution procedures that are similar to mediation will \\nnot be used to resolve matters involving an allegation of sexual violence (i.e. Sexual \\nAssault, Dating Violence, Domestic Violence or any other form of Prohibited Conduct that \\ninvolves the use of violence). After receiving a request to pursue an Alternative Resolution, the Title IX Coordinator will \\ncontact both parties to assess mutual interest in the Alternative Resolution. If both parties \\nwish to pursue Alternative Resolution, and the Title IX Coordinator agrees that Alternative \\nResolution is appropriate under the specific facts and circumstances of the case, the Title \\nIX Coordinator will provide the Complainant and Respondent with a written notice \\nproviding (i) the allegations in the Formal Complaint; (ii) the specific Alternative Resolution \\nmethod desired by the parties; (iii) details of the procedures for the Alternative \\nResolution; (iv) a summary of the possible consequences and outcomes of the Alternative \\nResolution, and (v) information regarding the confidentiality and/or accessibility of the \\nrecords of the Alternative Resolution. After receiving this notice, both \\nthe Complainant and Respondent must provide written consent to the Title IX Coordinator \\nin order to proceed with the Alternative Resolution. During any Alternative Resolution process, either party has the right to withdraw from the \\nprocess at any time prior to the conclusion of the process. If either party withdraws from \\nthe Alternative Resolution process or if the parties are unable to successfully resolve the \\nmatter at the conclusion of the Alternative Resolution process, the matter will proceed to \\ninvestigation under Section VI.B or to adjudication under Section VI.C or Section VI.E, as \\nappropriate. H. Student Emergency Removal \\nWhere there is an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any Students or \\nother individuals arising from alleged Prohibited Conduct, the university may remove an \\nindividual from the University’s Program or Activity and issue any necessary related no-\\ntrespass and no-contact orders during the pendency of the investigation. The university \\nwill make the decision to remove an individual from the University’s Program or \\nActivity based on an individualized assessment and risk analysis. For Students, an emergency removal decision will be made in accordance with the Safety \\nIntervention Protocol set forth in The Word. In the event the university removes any \\nperson on this basis, the university will provide an opportunity for the affected individual \\n', '240 \\n \\n \\nto challenge the removal promptly thereafter, as specified in the Safety Intervention \\nProtocol. VII.', 'Additional Information about Reporting \\nA. How the Title IX Coordinator and University Police Share Information about Prohibited \\nConduct with Each Other \\nThe university’s process for addressing Prohibited Conduct is separate from the law \\nenforcement process for addressing crimes. The university strongly believes that the decision as to whether to report a crime should \\nbe left to the individual(s) impacted by the crime, except in very limited circumstances \\nwhere there may be an immediate threat to the University Community. The Title IX \\nCoordinator will share de-identified information about reports with University Police for \\nthe purpose of complying with the university’s federal reporting obligations to facilitate \\naccurate compilation of crime statistics, and to ensure that other public safety \\nresponsibilities are addressed. In extremely limited circumstances, the Title IX Coordinator \\nmay share identifying information with University Police, for example, where the \\nuniversity is obligated to report a “Timely Warning” pursuant to Jeanne Clery Disclosure of \\nCampus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (e.g., when a crime has been \\ncommitted on or near University Property which represents a serious, ongoing threat \\nand/or is part of an ongoing pattern). The report does not constitute a criminal complaint \\nto law enforcement, although the University Police Department may contact individuals to \\noffer assistance, inquire about their willingness to preserve evidence, or file a criminal \\ncomplaint. Making a report to the University Police means that information will be shared with others \\nas is necessary and appropriate. For example, if an individual makes a report \\nof Prohibited Conduct to the University Police Department that has not already been \\nreported to the Title IX Coordinator, the University Police Department will report the \\nmatter to the Title IX Coordinator. The purpose of this report is to ensure that the \\nuniversity can take appropriate actions to seek to eliminate Prohibited Conduct, prevent \\nits recurrence, and remedy its effects. The Complainant or others may be contacted by \\nthe Title IX Coordinator to follow up on the information received from the University \\nPolice Department to offer supportive measures, including filing a Formal Complaint with \\nthe Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX. ', '241 \\n \\n \\nB. Time Frame for Reporting an Incident to the University \\nThe university strongly encourages individuals to report possible Prohibited \\nConduct promptly. Although the university does not limit the time frame for \\nreporting Prohibited Conduct, it may be more difficult for the university to gather relevant \\nand reliable evidence or to take corrective action regarding conduct that is reported to have \\noccurred relatively long ago. If the Respondent is no longer a Student, Staff member, Faculty member, or participant in \\nany university program or activity at the time of the report, or if the conduct does not fall \\nwithin the scope of the Policy, the university’s ability to take action against the Respondent \\nunder the Policy may be limited. The university will, however, also help \\na Complainant identify other options outside the university, such as local law \\nenforcement, and provide support and resources. C. Information on Amnesty to Students When Reporting Prohibited Conduct to the \\nUniversity \\nThe university will not pursue university Prohibited Conduct charges against any Student \\nin an investigation under this Policy for potential violations of university policy for \\npersonal consumption of alcohol or other drugs identified during an investigation, as long \\nas any such violations did not and do not place the health or safety of any other person at \\nrisk. The university may, however, initiate an assessment, educational discussion, or \\npursue other developmental interventions (non-disciplinary options) to address the \\nalcohol or other drug use. VIII. Obligations of University Employees \\nAll Carnegie Mellon community members are strongly encouraged to report information \\nabout potential violations of this Policy to the Title IX Coordinator. Sharing information \\nwith the Title IX Coordinator does not initiate a formal investigation or impose any \\nobligations on the Complainant. However, disclosing information to the Title IX \\nCoordinator enables the university to offer supportive measures to the party so that they \\nmay maintain equal access to their education and work environments. Responsible Employees have a heightened obligation to report information of potential \\npolicy violations. All Staff and Faculty who are Responsible Employees are required to \\npromptly share with the Title IX Coordinator all details they receive in the scope of their \\nemployment about Prohibited Conduct. Responsible Employees can make a report to the \\nTitle IX Coordinator by contacting the Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX. ', '242 \\n \\n \\nFailure by a Responsible Employees to promptly share with the Title IX Coordinator all \\ndetails they receive, including names of involved parties, in the scope of their employment \\nabout Prohibited Conduct may subject them to appropriate discipline, up to and including \\nremoval from their position. The following positions are Responsible Employees: \\n• University administrators and supervisors; and \\n• Employees holding any of the roles or titles list below, including those serving in an \\ninterim or acting basis: \\nFaculty or Staff Administrators \\n• President; \\n• Provost; \\n• Vice-Presidents (including those serving in associate and assistant roles); \\n• Vice-Provosts (including those serving in associate and assistant roles); \\n• Deans (including those serving in associate and assistant roles); \\n• Department Chairs (including those serving in associate and assistant roles, graduate \\nchairs, and undergraduate chairs); \\n• Directors; and \\n• Supervisors (i.e., employees who have authority to hire, transfer, suspend, layoff, \\nrecall, promote, discharge, reward, or discipline other employees). Student Affairs \\n• All Staff members (including any individual, whether an employee or not, who serves \\nas a coach of a club sports team), excluding administrative assistants, custodial, \\nmaintenance, and dining employees; and \\n• Community Advisors and Resident Assistants in Residential Education. Athletics \\n• All Staff members, excluding administrative assistants, custodial, maintenance, and \\ndining employees. University Police \\n• All Staff members. ', '243 \\n \\n \\nOther \\n• All Human Resources Staff members (central, school, college, division, and/or unit) who \\nare responsible for handling employment issues, excluding clerical and transactional \\nemployees; \\n• All Staff members and Faculty members who provide oversight to or travel with \\nStudents on university-related travel abroad, including university-sponsored study \\nabroad, research, fieldwork, or internship programs. Unless designated as \\na Responsible Employees in another role at the university, staff and Faculty \\nmembers who provide oversight to or travel with Students on university related travel \\nabroad, are only considered Responsible Employees with respect to concerns they \\nbecome aware of connected to the program with which they provide oversight or \\ntravel abroad with Students; and \\n• Faculty and Staff members serving as identified advisers to student organizations. Confidential Resources, such as individuals employed at CaPS and the University Health \\nCenter, acting in that capacity, are not Responsible Employees. Nevertheless, these \\nindividuals can serve as connection points to Supportive Measures through the Office for \\nInstitutional Equity and Title IX if desired by a party. Responsible Employees are not required to report when incidents of Prohibited Conduct \\nare communicated/disclosed during a classroom discussion, in an assignment for a class \\n(and in discussions outside of class time (e.g., during office hours) related to the \\nassignment), or as part of a research project directly associated with the class. Responsible Employees also are not required to report information disclosed at sexual \\nmisconduct public awareness events (e.g., Take Back the Night, candlelight vigils, protests, \\nor survivor speak-outs in which participants may disclose incidents of Prohibited \\nConduct). If you are unsure of whether you are a Responsible Employee, please contact the Title IX \\nCoordinator in order to help clarify your role and responsibilities. IX. Definitions \\nA. Sexual Misconduct Definitions \\nPROHIBITED CONDUCT means one or more categories of prohibited behavior including: \\n• Sexual Assault; \\n', '244 \\n \\n \\n• Sexual Exploitation; \\n• Sexual Harassment; \\n• Dating Violence; \\n• Domestic Violence; \\n• Stalking; \\n• Retaliation; and \\n• Violation of Protective Measures. Definitions for each of the types of Prohibited Conduct are provided below. SEXUAL HARASSMENT means any unwelcome conduct or cues of a sexual nature, whether \\nverbal/aural (sounds), visual/graphic (e.g. pictures and videos), physical, or otherwise, when: \\n• Submission to such conduct is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition \\nof a person’s employment, education, living environment, or participation in any \\nUniversity Program or Activity (commonly known as Quid Pro Quo); \\n• Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for or a \\nfactor in decisions affecting that individual’s employment, education, living \\nenvironment, or participation in a University Program or Activity (commonly known as \\nQuid Pro Quo); and/or \\n• Such conduct creates a hostile environment. A hostile environment exists when the \\nunwelcome conduct of a sexual nature is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive \\nthat it unreasonably interferes with an individual’s participation in a university \\nprogram or activity or creates an intimidating, hostile, offensive, or abusive \\nenvironment for that individual’s participation in a University Program or Activity \\n(commonly known as Hostile Environment). Examples of conduct that may constitute Sexual Harassment include but are not limited to: \\no Unwanted intentional touching that otherwise does not typically constitute Sexual \\nAssault, defined in this Policy; \\no Unwanted sexual advances, including repeated unwanted requests for dates, or \\nrepeated unwanted requests for sexual contact; \\no Unwanted written, verbal, or electronic statements of a sexual nature, including \\nsexually suggestive comments, jokes, videos or innuendos; \\n', '245 \\n \\n \\no Exposing one’s genitalia, breasts, or buttocks, to another; and/or \\no Touching oneself sexually for others to view. This definition addresses intentional conduct. It also includes conduct that results in \\nnegative effects even though such negative effects were unintended. Unwelcome conduct \\nof a sexual nature constitutes Sexual Harassment if a Reasonable Person would consider \\nit sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive as to interfere unreasonably with academic, \\nother educational, or employment performance or participation in a university activity or \\nliving environment. SEXUAL ASSAULT means a physical, sexual act directed against another person without their \\nConsent, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving Consent. Sexual Assault \\ncan occur between two individual of the same or different sexes and/or genders. This \\nincludes the following: \\nI. RAPE means the carnal knowledge of a person, without the Consent of the victim, \\nincluding instances where the victim does not have the Capacity to give Consent; \\nII. SODOMY means oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person, without the \\nConsent of the victim, including instances where the victim does not have the \\nCapacity to give Consent; \\nIII. SEXUAL ASSAULT WITH AN OBJECT means to use an object or instrument to \\nunlawfully penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of \\nanother person, without the Consent of the victim, including instances where the \\nvictim does not have the Capacity to give Consent; \\nIV. FONDLING means the touching of the private body parts of another person for the \\npurpose of sexual gratification, where the victim does not have the Capacity to give \\nConsent; \\nV. INCEST means sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other \\nwithin the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law; or \\nVI. STATUTORY RAPE means sexual intercourse with a person who is under the \\nstatutory age of Consent in the applicable jurisdiction. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the age of consent for sexual activity is 16. Minors aged 16 years of age or older can legally consent to sexual activity with \\nanyone they choose, as long as the other person does not have authority over them \\nas defined in Pennsylvania’s institutional sexual assault statute. Minors under the \\nage of 13 cannot consent to sexual activity. Minors aged 13-15 years old cannot \\n', \"246 \\n \\n \\nconsent to sexual activity with anyone who is 4 or more years older than they are at \\nthe time of the activity. DATING VIOLENCE means any act of violence, including sexual violence, physical violence, or \\nthe threat of such violence, committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship \\nof a romantic or intimate nature with the victim and where the existence of such a \\nrelationship is determined based on a consideration of the length, type, and frequency of \\ninteractions between the persons involved in the relationship. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE means any act of violence, including sexual violence, physical violence, \\nor the threat of such violence, committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner \\nof the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is \\ncohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner, by a \\nperson similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws \\nof the jurisdiction receiving grant monies, or by any other person against an adult or youth \\nvictim who is protected from that person's acts under the domestic or family violence laws of \\nthe jurisdiction. STALKING means engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would \\ncause a Reasonable Person to fear for his or her safety or the safety of others or suffer \\nsubstantial emotional distress. SEXUAL EXPLOITATION  \\nmeans intentionally or knowingly taking sexual advantage of another person or violating the \\nsexual privacy of another when Consent is not present. This includes, but is not limited to, \\nthe following actions (including when they are done via electronic means, methods or \\ndevices): \\n• engaging in sexual voyeurism including observing or permitting others to witness or \\nobserve the sexual or intimate activity (e.g., disrobing, bathing, toileting) of another \\nperson without that person’s Consent; \\n• engaging in indecent exposure, or exposing intimate parts (including genitalia, groin, \\nbreasts and/or buttocks), or causing another to expose intimate parts when Consent is \\nnot present; \\n• recording or distributing information, images or recordings of any person engaged in \\nsexual or intimate activity in a private space without that person’s Consent; \\n• prostituting another individual; \\n\", '247 \\n \\n \\n• causing Incapacitation of another person (through alcohol, drugs or other means) for \\nthe purpose of compromising that person’s ability to give Consent to non-consensual \\nsexual activity; or \\n• actively aiding or assisting another person in committing an act of Prohibited Conduct. RETALIATION means an adverse (negative) action taken against a person for making a \\ngood faith report of Prohibited Conduct, being alleged to have committed Prohibited \\nConduct, participating, or refusing to participate, in any proceeding under this Policy. • Retaliation may include intimidation, threats, coercion, harassment, or discrimination \\n(including charging a Respondent under a different university policy instead of this \\nPolicy for the purpose of interfering with any right or privileged secured by Title IX or \\nits implementing regulations). • Retaliation may also include adverse employment or educational actions that would \\ndiscourage a Reasonable Person from engaging in a Protected Activity protected under \\nthis Policy. A finding of retaliation under this Policy is not dependent on a finding that the underlying \\nsexual misconduct occurred. Retaliation is also prohibited by the university’s Policy Against \\nRetaliation. Supportive Measures and other actions taken in accordance with this or other university \\npolicies generally do not constitute Retaliation. Similarly, charging an individual with a code of \\nconduct violation for making a materially false statement in bad faith in the course of a \\ngrievance proceeding under this Policy does not constitute prohibited Retaliation, provided, \\nhowever, that a determination regarding responsibility, alone, is not sufficient to conclude that \\nany party made a materially false statement in bad faith. Retaliation also does not include \\npursuit of civil, criminal, or other legal action, internal or external to the university. PROTECTED ACTIVITY means participating in the university’s processes related to this \\nPolicy, including but not limited to reporting Prohibited Conduct; pursuing a resolution of \\nProhibited Conduct; providing evidence in any investigation or hearing; or intervening to \\nprotect others who may have suffered Prohibited Conduct. B. Definitions Relating to Consent \\nCONSENT means a knowing and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity at the \\ntime of the activity. In order to be valid, consent must be knowing, voluntary, active, \\n', '248 \\n \\n \\npresent and ongoing. Consent should be demonstrated through mutually understandable \\nwords or actions. • Silence, remaining still or inactive (passive), or not actively resisting sexual activity does \\nnot imply consent. • Consent to engage in one sexual activity does not mean consent to engage in another \\nsexual activity.', 'Consent must be obtained each time, at each step of sexual activity. • Prior consent does not mean future consent. Consent must be obtained each time, at \\neach step of sexual activity, even for those in an ongoing sexual relationship. • Consent can be withdrawn at any time. If one individual withdraws consent through \\nclear words or actions, the other person must cease sexual activity immediately. • Consent cannot be obtained through Force, Incapacitation or Coercion (as defined \\nhere in). FORCE means using physical control (such as restraining a person), physical violence (such \\nas hitting, choking or displaying a weapon), or threats of either to cause a person to \\nsubmit to unwanted sexual activity. COERCION means using an unreasonable amount of pressure or threats that would \\novercome the will of a Reasonable Person and cause them to submit to unwanted sexual \\nactivity. Coercion requires more than an attempt to persuade someone to engage in \\nsexual activity. Coercion can include threats, such as threats to cause academic, \\nemployment, reputational or economic harm. When one person expresses that they do \\nnot consent to sexual activity or are withdrawing consent for sexual activity, applying \\ncontinued pressure in order to get the person to submit to unwanted sexual activity can \\nbe considered Coercion. INCAPACITATION means that a person lacks the ability to make informed, deliberate \\nchoices about whether or not to engage in sexual activity. A person is Incapacitated — \\nunable to give consent — because they are: \\n• under the age of consent (generally 16 years of age in Pennsylvania; see definition of \\nStatutory Rape for additional information); \\n• physically or mentally helpless; \\n• asleep or unconscious; or \\n• unaware that sexual activity was requested, suggested, initiated and/or is taking place. ', '249 \\n \\n \\nA person may be Incapacitated by the use of alcohol or other drugs. Incapacitation is a state \\nbeyond intoxication or drunkenness. A person is not necessarily Incapacitated solely as a result \\nof drinking or using drugs; the level of impairment must be significant enough to render the \\nperson unable to give Consent. For example, a person who is Incapacitated may not be able to answer some or all of the \\nfollowing questions: \\no Do you know where you are? o Do you know how you got here? o Do you know what is happening? o Do you know whom you are with? A person who is Incapacitated may also demonstrate physical signs including but not limited to: \\no slurred or incomprehensible speech; \\no unsteady manner of walking or inability to walk; \\no vomiting or incontinence (a lack of voluntary control over urination and/or defecation). If a person under the influence of alcohol or drugs decides to participate in sexual activity that \\nthey would not participate in while sober, it does not necessarily mean that the person was \\nIncapacitated or that the Consent was not valid. Importantly, being impaired by alcohol or other drugs is not a defense to a failure to obtain \\nConsent. CAPACITY means that the person has the ability under the law to give Consent to engage \\nin sexual activity. This means that the person must be: \\n• Of legal age to give Consent (generally at least 16 years of age in Pennsylvania; see \\ndefinition of Statutory Rape for additional information); and \\n• Able to make informed, deliberate choices about whether or not to engage in sexual \\nactivity. A person who is not able to give consent is considered to be Incapacitated. C. Policy Definitions \\nACTUAL KNOWLEDGE means that the university has notice of alleged Sexual Misconduct \\nbecause the alleged misconduct has been reported to the Title IX Coordinator or any \\nofficial of the university who has the authority to institute corrective measures on behalf \\n', '250 \\n \\n \\nof the university. These are individuals whose “actual knowledge” may be imputed to the \\nuniversity. ADVISOR: An individual who provides support and advice for the Complainant or \\nRespondent. The Complainant and Respondent may have an Advisor of their choice, who \\nmay be, but is not required to be, an attorney. If either party does not have an Advisor present at the live hearing conducted under \\nSection VI.C, the university will provide, without fee or charge to that party, a substitute \\nAdvisor of the university’s choice who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney. In \\nthis event, the role of the Advisor provided by the university will be limited to the \\nconducting of cross examination on behalf of the party that did not have an Advisor. COMPLAINANT: In most circumstances, Complainant means a person who is reported to \\nhave experienced Prohibited Conduct. The term Complainant also includes such \\nindividuals who file a Formal Complaint and who participates in a process undertaken by \\nthe university to address the report of Prohibited Conduct (including Federal Rule Sexual \\nMisconduct). In some cases, a Complainant may be different than the person who initially \\nreports information to the university. EMPLOYEE: person who is employed by the university to perform one or more of the \\nfollowing roles: regular instructional faculty, supplemental instructional faculty, research \\ntrack faculty, visiting faculty, librarians, archivists, curators, graduate student instructors, \\ngraduate student staff assistants, graduate student research assistants, postdoctoral \\nresearch fellows, and all regular and temporary staff. FACULTY/FACULTY MEMBER means all individuals who hold appointments on the tenure-\\ntrack, research-track, teaching-track, librarian/archivist-track and special faculty track of \\nthe university, as well as individuals holding Emeritus Faculty status. FEDERAL RULE SEXUAL MISCONDUCT is a subset of Prohibited Conduct which meets the \\ndefinition of Sexual Harassment in the Title IX Regulations at 34 CFR Part 106.30. Something which meets the definition of category of Prohibited Conduct (defined above) \\nrises to the level of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct when it meets ALL of the following \\nthree conditions: \\n• The alleged conduct was perpetrated against a person in the United States; and \\n• The conduct took place within the University’s Programs or Activities. PLUS one or more of the following conditions: \\n', '251 \\n \\n \\ni. An Employee engages in Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment against a Student; and/or \\nii. An individual engages in hostile environment Sexual Harassment that is so severe, \\npervasive, and objectively offensive that it denies another person equal access to \\nthe University’s Programs or Activities; and/or \\niii. An individual engages in Sexual Assault, Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, or \\nStalking. FORMAL COMPLAINT means a written or typed document, signed by the Complainant or \\nthe Title IX Coordinator (electronically or otherwise), which requests that the university \\ninitiate the procedures outlined in Section VI. If the Complainant is under the age of 18 \\nand not enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate program, the Complainant’s parent or \\nguardian must sign the Formal Complaint. OTHER PROHIBITED CONDUCT means any Prohibited Conduct that does not meet the \\ndefinition of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct. REASONABLE PERSON a person using average care, intelligence, and judgment in the \\nknown circumstances. REPORT means information shared with the university’s Title IX Coordinator about one or \\nmore incidents of Prohibited Conduct which have occurred (or is continuing to occur) and \\nwhich: \\n• has impacted (or continues to impact) one or more members of the University \\nCommunity; and/or \\n• was or is committed by one or more members of the University Community; and/or \\n• occurred or is occurring on property owned or controlled by the University or within \\nthe University’s Programs or Activities. RESPONDENT: an individual who is reported to have engaged in Prohibited Conduct \\n(including Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct). RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYEE: an individual who is required to report information of alleged \\nProhibited Misconduct (including Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct) to the university’s Title \\nIX Coordinator. The categories of “Responsible Employee” includes: \\n1. University administrators and supervisors; and \\n2. Employees in certain designated positions and units or departments. A Responsible Employee is required to share all relevant information about the alleged \\nProhibited Conduct, of which they are aware, with the Title IX Coordinator within 48 \\n', \"252 \\n \\n \\nhours of learning them. Relevant information includes (to the extent known by the \\nResponsible Employee):  \\na. Name (or names) of the Complainant(s); \\nb. Name (or names) of Respondent(s); \\nc. Details about the nature of the alleged Prohibited Conduct; and \\nd. Any information available about location(s), date(s), and/or time(s). A full list of Responsible Employees and more information about a Responsible \\nEmployee’s obligations can be found in Section VIII. A Responsible Employee’s receipt of information about alleged Prohibited Conduct (including \\nFederal Rule Sexual Misconduct) will not automatically trigger a formal resolution under this \\nPolicy. The university will only commence Formal Resolution upon receipt of a Formal \\nComplaint signed by the Complainant or the Title IX Coordinator. STAFF/STAFF MEMBER means all Employees of the university who do not hold faculty \\nappointments. Staff does not include individuals whose primary relationship with the \\nuniversity is as a Student. STUDENT a person who was selected by the university for part-time, full-time, special, \\nassociate, transfer, exchange, or any other enrollment, membership, or matriculation in \\nor at any of the University’s Programs or Activities. UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY refers to university Students, Faculty and Staff. UNIVERSITY'S PROGRAMS OR ACTIVITIES: Conduct takes place in the “University’s \\nPrograms or Activities” when that conduct occurs: (1) in a location, at an event, or in a \\ncircumstance where the university exercises substantial control over both the Respondent \\nand the context in which the conduct occurs; or (2) in any building owned or controlled by \\na student organization recognized by the university. Examples: Conduct that occurs on-campus occurs within the University’s Programs or \\nActivities. Conduct that occurs off campus in locations or at events with no connection to \\nthe university is unlikely to occur in a program or activity of the university. VIOLATION OF PROTECTIVE MEASURES \\nAny violation of an agreement or order that limits an individual’s contact or interactions \\nwith another individual. Such agreement or order may have been issued under the \\nauthority of the university, another institution, or a local, state or federal government or \\ncourt. \", '253 \\n \\n \\nAppendix A:  Possible Sanctions and Remedies \\nPossible outcomes from a violation of this Policy may include non-punitive remedies and \\npunitive sanctions.

Miscellaneous \\n15. The party seeking to introduce Expert Witness testimony is solely response for any all \\nexpenses and fees charged by Expert Witness. Smoke-less Campus Policy \\nPolicy Rationale \\nThe university is committed to promoting a safe, healthy working and learning \\nenvironment. This commitment extends to encouraging and supporting the reduction of \\nsignificant health risks to members of the community. Smoking of tobacco products is one \\nsuch risk. This Policy is intended not only to relieve community members from negative \\neffects of tobacco smoking by others, but also to promote and assist smoking cessation \\nby existing users and discourage new addictions. Policies that strictly regulate smoking have been demonstrated to reduce exposure to \\nsecond-hand smoke, tobacco-related death and disease, and attendant healthcare costs. In addition, several systematic reviews of studies have demonstrated effectiveness of \\nsuch policies in reducing the prevalence of tobacco use, increasing the number of tobacco \\nusers who quit, and reducing the initiation of tobacco use among young people. These \\npositive effects have led leading national health organizations to advocate a smoke-free \\npolicy intervention. Benchmarking suggests that a “smoke-less” approach, an alternative \\nto prohibition that honors our campus geography and is grounded in sustained and \\nvisible efforts to reduce smoking and promote cessation, can also have positive effects. The effects of exposure to smoke from tobacco were documented in the 2006, 2010, and \\n2014 U.S. Surgeon General’s Reports. Further research is needed to determine the public \\nhealth risks and benefits of e-cigarettes and other novel nicotine products. Although \\nharmful consequences of e-cigarette vapor have not been demonstrated to the standards \\n', '257 \\n \\n \\nused for conventional cigarettes, the practice of using these products may have social \\nimpact. In addition, some state and local governments, including Allegheny County, have \\npassed laws regulating the use of e-cigarettes. Therefore, this Policy addresses both the \\nsmoking of tobacco products and the use of e-cigarettes. As evidence becomes more \\nconclusive, this Policy may be amended to further address novel nicotine products. Policy Statement \\nSmoking of tobacco products is prohibited in all university buildings and facilities owned, \\nleased, or operated by Carnegie Mellon University, including campus vehicles. Smoking of \\ntobacco products is also prohibited on all grounds and outside areas except for limited \\ndesignated outdoor areas where the negative effects of second-hand exposure is deemed \\nsufficiently low. As such, major campus thoroughfares, gathering spaces and entrances to \\nbuildings are not designated areas. The number, nature and location of designated areas \\nwas determined by an oversight committee convened by the university’s Environmental \\nHealth & Safety department and comprised of representatives from Faculty Senate, \\nGraduate Student Assembly, Staff Council and Student Senate. • Designated Smoking Areas [pdf] \\n• Tobacco Cessation Resources [pdf] \\nUse of e-cigarettes and vaporizers is prohibited inside all university buildings and inside all \\nproperty owned, leased or operated by Carnegie Mellon University, but is not prohibited \\noutside on campus grounds as of the adoption of this Policy. For the purpose of this Policy, a tobacco product is defined as any product made or \\nderived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption by smoking. Examples of \\ntobacco products include, but are not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, little cigars, and pipe \\ntobacco. For the purpose of this Policy, an e-cigarette is defined as any electronic oral device, such \\nas one composed of a heating element, battery or electronic circuit, which provides a \\nvapor of nicotine or any other substances and the use or inhalation of which simulates \\nsmoking. The term shall include any such device, whether manufactured, distributed, \\nmarketed or sold as an e-cigarette, e-cigar or e-pipe or under any other product name or \\ndescriptor. This Policy does not apply to the use of tobacco products, e-cigarettes or vaporizers for \\nofficial academic research so long as such use of these products complies with all \\napplicable local, state, and federal laws. ', \"258 \\n \\n \\nSocial Regulations \\nEvents that are in any way identified with Carnegie Mellon and are conducted by students \\nor student organizations for purely social purposes are covered by the following \\nregulations: \\n• Any such event, whether on or off campus, must comply with city, state and federal \\nlaws. Carnegie Mellon accepts no responsibility for the direct supervision of the social \\nactivities engaged in by its students and student organizations. • Student organizations must submit this form to the Director of Student Leadership, \\nInvolvement and Civic Engagement for review and approval prior to any events being \\nheld during final examinations, during final examinations, on the night before any \\nrecess, or during any recess of more than three days duration. • It is expected that students will organize and conduct social activities in a responsible \\nmanner. • The university reserves the right to review the planning for social events requiring the \\nuse of university facilities and to establish special requirements as needed to ensure \\nthe well-being of all students. Last revised Spring 1998. Statement of Assurance Policy \\nThe Statement of Assurance must be placed in all graduate and undergraduate admissions \\npublications and all other publications where such a statement is necessary or appropriate. Also, the Carnegie Mellon Writer's Style Guide gives detailed guidance on how to use the \\nstatement of assurance in campus-related publications. Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment, or \\nadministration of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, \\nhandicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, \\nbelief, veteran status, or genetic information. Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon University does \\nnot discriminate and is required not to discriminate in violation of federal, state, or local laws \\nor executive orders. Inquiries concerning the application of and compliance with this statement should be \\ndirected to the Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX, Carnegie Mellon University, 4615 \\nForbes Avenue, Suite 330, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, telephone 412-268-7125. Obtain general information about Carnegie Mellon University by calling 412-268-2000. \", '259 \\n \\n \\nSteam Tunnels \\nBecause of the danger to all who enter them, the steam tunnels are locked and anyone \\nfound in the tunnels will be subject to serious disciplinary action and/or criminal action. The \\nUniversity Police are responsible for keeping the tunnels locked and apprehending anyone \\nwho trespasses in them. Student Accounts Receivable Collection Policy and Procedures \\nPlease refer to the current Student Financial Obligation Statement. That statement is \\nprovided to all students through the Student Information Online (SIO). Questions about this \\nstatement may be directed to The HUB. Student Damage to Carnegie Mellon Property Policy \\nStudents will be charged with the cost of restoring to its proper condition any Carnegie \\nMellon property that, through their negligence or misuse, has been damaged. Responsible parties will be subject to disciplinary action if said damages are found to have \\nbeen intentional or caused as a result of improper behavior. All such damages should be \\nreported promptly to the Campus Police. When individual responsibility cannot be assigned, the members of the group to whom a \\nspace has been assigned or property supplied may be charged (as individuals) for the cost of \\nrepairs, and may be subject to disciplinary action. Student Enterprises \\nStudents who wish to form a student-run business or enterprise must submit a proposal in \\nwriting for approval by the dean of student affairs, the vice president for campus affairs and \\nchief financial officer. Any approved enterprise will be required to pay a university overhead \\ncharge, which will be determined in negotiations with the Division of Finance. Student Health Insurance Policy \\nPolicy Rationale \\nThe cost of health care in the United States presents a potentially serious health risk and \\nfinancial risk to students and their accompanying dependents. The absence of adequate \\nhealth insurance coverage is a barrier to care that can result in temporary or permanent \\n', '260 \\n \\n \\ninterruption of a student’s education. The university is committed to offering student \\nhealth insurance that provides access to quality health care and achieves a balance \\nbetween premium cost and adequate coverage without overburdening students’ financial \\nresources. This balance is best achieved through a student health insurance requirement \\nthat mitigates the effect of adverse selection while providing another option for coverage. Policy Statement \\nAll full-time students are required to carry health insurance that meets certain standards \\nof coverage. In the absence of adequate health insurance coverage, the student is \\nrequired to enroll in the student health insurance plan. Implementation Guidelines \\nThe process for selection of vendors for the student health insurance plan shall adhere to \\ninstitutional requirements relative to competitive vendor selection processes. The student \\nhealth insurance program shall be reviewed annually by University Health Services (UHS) \\nand student consumers including representatives from Student Senate and the Graduate \\nStudent Assembly to ensure that the program meets the needs of covered individuals, \\nprovides the desired level of benefit at the least possible cost and returns as much of the \\npremium to covered individuals in the form of benefits as possible. The health insurance program shall be available to all eligible students without regard to \\nrace, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender \\nidentity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, pre-existing medical or mental \\nhealth condition or genetic information. All full-time students will be assessed a charge for the individual basic health insurance \\nplan offered through the university student health insurance program. The charge will \\nappear on the invoice of the first semester of attendance in the academic cycle. The \\nstudent is expected to actively enroll in the plan or apply for a waiver from the student \\ninsurance plan during the open enrollment. Failure to take action will result in automatic \\nenrollment in the student health insurance plan. Application or modification of this policy for non-Pittsburgh locations will be determined \\nby the Director of University Health Services, in consultation with relevant colleagues in \\nthose locations. Requirements for Waiver \\nApplication for waiver from the university student health insurance plan must be \\nsubmitted to UHS by the last day of the open enrollment period. Students applying for \\nwaiver must provide documentation of: \\n', '261 \\n \\n \\n• Coverage by a carrier that has offices based in the U.S. • Continuing coverage that verifies enrollment as the dependent, partner/spouse or \\nprincipal in an employer, state or federally operated insurance Exchange or \\ngovernment sponsored insurance plan. • Enrollment in a plan that meets certain minimum standards for coverage as set forth \\nby the university including but not limited to an adequate level of coverage for \\nmedical, mental health and substance abuse services at the primary, emergency, \\ninpatient and outpatient level in the geographic location of study. Failure to maintain continuous coverage will result in automatic enrollment in the student \\nhealth insurance standard plan. Unauthorized Possession of Keys \\nStudents found using or having in their possession key(s) or key card(s) to any university \\ndoors or facilities that they are unauthorized to use or possess will be subject to disciplinary \\naction. Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)/Drones \\nUnmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), including aircraft commonly known as drones, are used at \\nCarnegie Mellon University in a variety of ways related to academics, research, business and \\nrecreation. All members of the Carnegie Mellon community and guests on university property \\nare expected to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding the \\noperation of UAS. In particular, all outdoor UAS operations must comply with Federal Aviation \\nAdministration (FAA) regulations. Indoor UAS operation is not regulated by the FAA.

We are a community with high expectations for those who choose to \\nbecome members, including established community standards intended to foster behavior that \\nis consistent with an educational setting where each member can achieve their full potential \\nCommunity Standards Overview \\nIt is the responsibility of each community member to become familiar with the standards and \\nexpectations of the Carnegie Mellon community. In general, each member should: \\n• Respect the rights of others; \\n• Respect the property of individuals, groups and Carnegie Mellon; \\n• Know, understand and abide by all Carnegie Mellon community standards, policies and \\nregulations, as well as all local, state and federal laws; \\n• Engage in behavior that does not interfere with individual, group or Carnegie Mellon regular \\nactivities and/or operation; \\n• Ensure that guests behave in a manner consistent with and in accordance with the \\nexpectations of our community. At the core, our standards, policies and procedures are designed to: \\n• promote and protect the rights of all members and guests of our community; \\n• promote and protect the health and safety of all members and guests of our community; \\n• promote the respect of and protect community members’ and University property; \\n• promote and protect the academic integrity of our community. The Word provides a list of policies students are expected to uphold and the process by which \\nviolations will be addressed. Policies and procedures may be established or amended as \\nnecessary during the course of the academic year, which will become effective immediately \\nupon notification by the dean of students. In all cases involving infractions of community standards (excluding the adjudication of Federal \\nRule Sexual Misconduct under Section VI.C of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) the \\nfollowing procedures will be used: \\n', '268 \\n \\n \\n1. The Resolution Review Board will review the case and determine the appropriate venue for \\nresolution. 2. When appropriate, an Administrative Resolution Meeting will take place with a university \\nadjudicator. If the student respondent and the university adjudicator can resolve the \\nmatter, the student will be notified in writing of the determined action once said action is \\napproved by the Resolution Review Board. 3. When the University Disciplinary Committee is assigned original jurisdiction or when \\nAdministrative Resolution has failed, the procedures outlined in the Conduct of University \\nDisciplinary Committee Hearings will apply. A student who requires accommodations due to a disability in order to full participate in the \\ncommunity standards process should contact the Carnegie Mellon University Office of Disability \\nResources which provides responsive and reasonable accommodations to students who self-\\nidentify as having a disability, including physical, sensory, cognitive and emotional disabilities. The university’s policy on Student Accommodations is available at \\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/disability-resources/policies-guidelines/. Additional information regarding \\nthe Office of Disability Resources, including how to request accommodations, is available at \\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/disability-resources/. Community Standards Violations \\nThe following are groups of violations that constitute misconduct for which members of the \\nstudent body may be held accountable. This list references policies that may be outlined in \\ngreater detail in this on-line handbook or other campus resources. The university is not limited \\nby this list nor by other published policies when it initiates community standards actions since it \\nis not possible to anticipate all of the behavior of a college population. Additionally, University \\ndepartments and units may maintain specific policies or guidelines enforceable by their \\nrespective procedures separate from community standards action (e.g. University Libraries, \\nTransportation Services, Environmental Health and Safety, Office for Institutional Equity and Title \\nIX, etc.). The university reserves the right to review off-campus incidents to determine if a violation of \\ncommunity standards has occurred and whether resolution through the appropriate process is \\nwarranted. ', \"269 \\n \\n \\nStudents at Carnegie Mellon are members of an academic community dedicated to the \\nachievement of excellence. Therefore, students are expected to meet the highest standards of \\nintegrity in their conduct. Failure to meet the expectations of high standards of integrity may be \\nreviewed through the university community standards process. Examples of violations of \\ncommunity standards in relation to integrity include, but are not limited to: \\n• Altering, falsifying, or misuse of university documents \\n• Destruction of another person's work, specifically through the use of computer facilities \\n• Falsification of data \\n• Intentional misrepresentation of self or another individual through electronic communication \\nor any other means \\n• Invasion of or accessing personal files or a computer account other than one's own \\n• Misrepresentation of research data \\n• Misuse of computer facilities \\n• Other acts that compromise the integrity of the academic process \\n• Providing false information to a university official \\n• Reverse engineering software or hardware without permission of the intellectual property \\nowner \\n• Violation of copyright laws including computing or Web-related documentation \\n• Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Computing Policy \\n• Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Policy on Academic Integrity including cheating, \\nplagiarism or unauthorized assistance \\n• Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Policy on the Protection of Children in Carnegie \\nMellon University Programs, Activities and Facilities \\n \\nCarnegie Mellon University holds as its highest priority the welfare of its community members. Any behavior that places individuals or the community at risk for harm may be reviewed \\nthrough the university community standards process.

This person is usually a housefellow \\nor college liaison, but the dean of students or designee may also act as an adjudicator. • Complainant – The person(s) or group bringing allegations forward in the community \\nstandards process. In cases where there is no individual bringing forward an allegation, the \\nuniversity may act as complainant. Further, in cases where there is a community member \\nbringing forward an allegation, a university official may serve as co-complainant where the \\nuniversity determines that a broader community interest exists to safeguard the welfare of \\nthe university community and when the potential outcome in such a case could include \\nseparation from the university. • Hearing Officer – The Hearing Officer is appointed by the dean of students or designee. A \\nHearing Officer may be an employee of Carnegie Mellon, or a third party engaged by the \\nuniversity, who has been trained to serve in this role. The Hearing Officer is responsible for \\nconducting the hearing, making a determination regarding relevancy of information as well \\nas responsibility for each allegation. If applicable, the Hearing Officer will recommend \\noutcomes to the Associate Vice President of Student Affairs for Community Life. • Moderator – The Student Affairs staff member who facilitates a University Disciplinary \\nCommittee hearing. Moderators are appointed and trained by the Office of Community \\nStandards & Integrity. The hearing runs at their discretion according to process guidelines. • Process Advisor – As a member of the team in the Office of Community Standards & Integrity, \\nthe Process Advisor is responsible for the logistics of convening a University Disciplinary \\nCommittee. The Process Advisor schedules the hearing, assembles the hearing board, \\ninforms the complainant(s) and respondent(s) of the procedures for the hearing, and \\nmanages other administrative tasks. • Resolution – Typically, the result of a complaint being adjudicated through the community \\nstandards process which may entail administrative resolution or the University Disciplinary \\n', \"273 \\n \\n \\nCommittee. However, a complaint may be resolved informally outside of the community \\nstandards process at the discretion of the dean of students or designee and the individuals \\ninvolved in the matter. • Resolution Review Board – The team of designated and trained staff that reviews and \\napproves initial allegations and determines appropriate venues for resolution through the \\ncommunity standards process. The Resolution Review Board also reviews and approves \\nproposed outcomes stemming from Administrative Resolution Meetings. • Respondent – The person(s), group, or student organization alleged to have violated \\ncommunity standards. • Student – Any person registered for, enrolled in, or auditing any course(s) at Carnegie Mellon \\nUniversity at the time of the alleged violation. For community standards purposes, an \\nindividual is also considered to be a student if they have accepted their offer of admission \\nand are not yet enrolled. Examples include, but are not limited to, students who are enrolled \\nbut not taking classes due to an academic break, medical leave, suspension, or other \\npersonal leave; students who were enrolled at the time of the incident; persons who \\ndemonstrate an intent to enroll by registering for courses; and students participating in study \\nabroad programs. • Support Person – A person of the student's choosing who accompanies the student to any \\nmeeting related to the community standards process, including a University Disciplinary \\nCommittee hearing. The role of the support person is limited to supporting the student in \\nmeetings or a hearing. Support persons may not actively participate in meetings, the hearing \\nprocess or communicate on the student's behalf. • Witness – Individuals positioned to provide direct information related to the alleged \\nviolations being reviewed by the University Disciplinary Committee, such as direct \\nobservation of the incident in question and/or direct interaction with  \\nThe Community Standards Process \\nStaff members in the Division of Student Affairs adjudicate alleged violations of community \\nstandards by students through the community standards process. The following forums exist for \\nformal resolution of alleged violations: \\n• Administrative Resolution Meeting with a university adjudicator \\n• University Disciplinary Committee (UDC) \\n\", \"274 \\n \\n \\n• Hearing Officer \\n• Academic Review Board (ARB) \\n For incidents that pose immediate concerns for the safety and welfare of the campus \\ncommunity, during the tendency of university community standards proceedings, the university \\nmay conduct a review per the Safety Intervention Protocol to determine whether it is necessary \\nto take summary action or implement interim measures that limit a student's ability to be \\npresent on campus, engage in coursework, and/or interact with specific members of the \\nuniversity community until resolution is reached. Additionally, when circumstances warrant, the dean of students or designee may modify these \\nprocedures to ensure the safety and welfare of the campus community. Initiating the Community Standards Process \\nIn order to initiate the community standards process, the Office of Community Standards & \\nIntegrity must receive a complaint or report that substantiates the facts and circumstances \\nassociated with any alleged violation(s) of community standards by a Carnegie Mellon \\nstudent. The initial information for the complaint or report may be provided by a student, \\nfaculty, staff member, or non-affiliate directly to the Office of Community Standards & \\nIntegrity or via the following: \\n• Campus Security Authority (as defined in the university’s Annual Security and Fire Safety \\nReport); \\n• Carnegie Mellon University’s Ethics Reporting Hotline; \\n• Carnegie Mellon University’s Bias Reporting Resources; \\n• Carnegie Mellon University Police Department; \\n• City of Pittsburgh Police and/or other law enforcement agency; \\n• Information Security Office; or \\n• Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX. The Office of Community Standards & Integrity has the authority to review and adjudicate all \\nviolations of university standards, policies and regulations that involve students. The \\nuniversity community standards process may not be used for the adjudication of cases \\ninvolving the relationships or interactions between two parties that do not involve alleged \\nviolations of community standards. Additionally, a complaint may be resolved informally \\n\", '275 \\n \\n \\noutside of the community standards process at the discretion of the dean of students or \\ndesignee and with the agreement of the individuals involved in the matter. As needed the Resolution Review Board (RRB) is empowered to review initial complaints and \\ndetermine whether there is a reasonable basis for resolution via the community standards \\nprocess. When reviewing a complaint, the Resolution Review Board will consider if the \\ndescribed behavior could violate a University policy or community standard if shown to be \\ntrue. The RRB may determine the described behavior does not constitute a violation of \\ncommunity standards or the complaint does not contain enough information to make such a \\ndetermination and may request additional information or further investigation. The RRB may \\ndismiss a complaint when it is determined there is no reasonable basis for resolution via the \\ncommunity standards process. Complaints that are dismissed may be resolved via an \\ninformal process including, but not limited to, conflict coaching, facilitating a dialogue, \\nmediation, restorative practices, or shuttle diplomacy. Student organizations, as members of the academic community, are expected to uphold \\nuniversity policies and community standards. Alleged violations of community standards \\nassociated with student organization activities may be reviewed through the community \\nstandards process. Individual students may be held accountable through the community \\nstandards process separate from any sanctions imposed on an organization found \\nresponsible for violating community standards. Withdrawal of a Complaint \\nGenerally, when pending allegations are withdrawn by the complainant, the allegations \\nmay not be refiled unless new information becomes available that was not previously \\navailable. The refiled complaint will be reviewed by the Resolution Review Board to \\ndetermine if the allegations should move forward based on the current \\ncircumstances. For allegations of sexual misconduct involving student respondents under \\nSection VI.E of the sexual misconduct policy (i.e. Other Prohibited Conduct), this \\nwithdrawal of complaint rule applies only after the final investigative report is provided to \\nthe Office of Community Standards & Integrity for adjudication through the community \\nstandards process. Engagement Expectations \\nIt is an expectation that students involved in the community standards process make a \\ngood faith effort to participate and bring the matter to resolution. If a Complainant ceases to engage in the resolution process, the Resolution Review Board \\nmay elect to dismiss the allegations or the RRB may allow the allegations to proceed with \\n', \"276 \\n \\n \\na university official serving as the Complainant. Allegations dismissed by RRB may not be \\nrefiled by the Complainant unless new information is available that was not previously \\navailable. If a Respondent ceases to participate in the process, the university may proceed to make a \\ndetermination via Administrative Resolution or schedule and conduct a University \\nDisciplinary Committee without that student's participation. Overriding Community Interest in Community Standards Matters \\nThere are some circumstances in which an overriding community interest will necessitate \\nengagement of the community standards process even if the impacted party does not \\nwish to pursue it as a means of resolution. The Office of Community Standards & Integrity in consultation with the Resolution Review \\nBoard will determine if an overriding community interest exists. The Title IX Coordinator \\nwill play a key role in determining the existence of an overriding community interest in \\ncases involving alleged violations of the Carnegie Mellon Sexual Misconduct Policy \\n(Interim). In circumstances where an impacted party does not wish to pursue action through the \\ncommunity standards process and it is determined that an overriding community interest \\nexists, the University will bring the matter for review via the community standards \\nprocess. The impacted party will be informed of this decision as well as their options for \\nparticipation in the resolution process. Administrative Resolution Meeting \\nA student is expected to meet with a university adjudicator to attempt to resolve alleged \\nviolation(s) of university community standards. A successful administrative resolution \\nmeeting will include the following:  \\n1. The facts must be determined. The student must agree that essential facts related to the \\nincident are undisputed. 2. A violation of community standards must be determined. The student must agree that \\nwhat occurred during the incident was a violation of the university's community \\nstandards. 3. A proposed outcome or set of outcomes must be determined. The student and \\nadjudicator must jointly agree about what outcome or set of outcomes will be proposed \\n\", \"277 \\n \\n \\nfor resolution of the matter, taking into account where appropriate the concerns of the \\nreporting party. The aforementioned proposed outcome or set of outcomes will be reviewed by the \\nResolution Review Board. If approved, the student will receive notification in writing \\nconfirming the determined action, which then becomes final. If agreement on the \\nappropriate action cannot be reached, the matter may be referred to the University \\nDisciplinary Committee for review. Should a student be non-responsive to notification of an alleged violation of the university's \\ncommunity standards, after a reasonable period of time and having made reasonable \\nattempts to contact the Respondent, the university adjudicator may make a determination \\nregarding responsibility and assign restorative outcomes and/or a period of disciplinary \\nprobation based on the information available. Consistent with Administrative Resolution \\nprocedures, this determination will be forwarded to the Resolution Review Board for \\napproval. Violations that may result in disciplinary suspension and where the student is non-\\nresponsive will be referred to the University Disciplinary Committee for resolution. University Disciplinary Committee \\nThe University Disciplinary Committee has jurisdiction in the following cases: \\n1. Any cases of alleged violations of university standards and policies that the Resolution \\nReview Board deems sufficiently serious in nature or inappropriate for administrative \\nresolution. 2. Any cases of alleged violations of university standards and policies in which one \\nstudent(s) is filing allegation against another student(s) that cannot be appropriately \\nresolved through the administrative resolution process. 3. Appeals referred by the dean of students or designee to review summary actions \\nimposed by a university adjudicator or university staff member. 4. Cases in which administrative resolution has not been successful. When circumstances warrant, at the discretion of the Dean of Students or designee, a case \\nmay be reviewed by a Hearing Officer in lieu of the University Disciplinary Committee. In such \\ncases, the procedures outlined in Conduct of University Disciplinary Committee Hearings will \\nbe utilized. \", '278 \\n \\n \\nComposition of the University Disciplinary Committee \\nEach case presented to the University Disciplinary Committee is heard by two student \\nboard members, one staff board member, one faculty board member and one additional \\nfaculty or staff board member. In addition, a trained moderator will preside over the \\nhearing. The faculty members will be appointed by the Office of Community Standards & \\nIntegrity  in consultation with Faculty Senate. The staff members will be appointed by the \\nOffice of the Community Standards & Integrity in consultation with Staff Council. The \\nstudent members will be appointed by the Office of Community Standards & Integrity in \\nconsultation with Undergraduate Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly \\nfollowing a selection process coordinated by the Office of Community Standards & \\nIntegrity. All appointees must complete initial and ongoing training in order to be eligible \\nto serve as board members. Once trained, board members may complete up to three \\nyears of service. Board members may be reappointed to successive three year terms. Members participating in a given hearing will be selected from a list of eligible individuals \\nbased upon availability and disinterestedness in the case or parties following review by \\nthe parties who are appearing before the University Disciplinary Committee. The following \\ncircumstance would preclude participation as a board member in a given hearing: \\n• Individuals with prior substantial knowledge of or interest in the student(s) involved or \\nthe event(s) leading to the allegations. • Individuals with a conflict of interest with the student(s), witnesses or other parties to \\nthe case. • Individuals who may appropriately be a witness in the case. Conduct of University Disciplinary Committee Hearings \\nThe university attempts to ensure fair, timely and orderly procedures in all community \\nstandards reviews. To provide for this, the university has adopted the following \\nprocedural protections that govern the University Disciplinary Committee process: \\nHearing Preparation and Scheduling \\n1. The logistics of hearing preparation and scheduling will be coordinated by a process \\nadvisor in the Office of Community Standards & Integrity. 2. The student must be notified in writing of the specific policy, standard or regulation \\nthe student has allegedly violated. Such notification is normally made at least seven \\ncalendar days before the hearing. ', '279 \\n \\n \\n3. Throughout the community standards process, the student respondent will receive \\nfull notification of complaint, notification of any hearing and notification of \\ndisposition of the charge and will have the opportunity to be present throughout the \\nhearing process. 4. The complainant will receive full notification of the complaint, notification of any \\nhearing, and will have the opportunity to be present throughout the hearing process. 5. Prior to the hearing, the individuals involved will be asked if they believe that the \\npotential hearing board members are aware of any significant relationship or interaction \\nthat might impair their ability to render an objective recommendation for resolution of \\nthe matter under review. The process advisor will consider this in seating the board for \\nthe hearing. 6. Written introductions are an opportunity for either party to offer their initial thoughts \\nand general sentiments about the allegations under review by the University \\nDisciplinary Committee. 7. During process advisement, the complainant and respondent will be provided a \\nhearing packet, which may include, among other relevant items: the initial \\ncomplainant report; any investigation reports and/or witness statements; a written \\nintroduction from the complainant(s) to the board; and a written introduction from \\nthe respondent(s) to the board. This packet may be used for the purpose of \\npreparing for or use during the hearing, consistent with the privacy rights of those \\ninvolved. These materials are to be kept private and may be shared only with \\npermission from the process advisor. These documents may not be duplicated nor \\nutilized for any other purpose. 8. In advance of the hearing, the members of the University Disciplinary Committee will \\nbe provided a hearing packet, which may include, among other relevant items: the \\ninitial complainant report; any investigation reports and/or witness statements; a \\nwritten introduction from the complainant(s) to the board; and a written introduction \\nfrom the respondent(s) to the board. Board members are expected to keep the \\ninformation reviewed during a University Disciplinary Committee confidential. 9. Complainant(s) and respondent(s) may submit up to three written letters of support \\nat a date specified by the process advisor for consideration only during the outcomes \\nphase of the proceeding in the event that the respondent is found responsible. ', \"280 \\n \\n \\n10. It is the responsibility of the Office of Community Standards & Integrity to ensure that \\ntimes set for hearings are reasonable and that necessary accommodations have been \\noffered to both the complainant and respondent whenever appropriate. In turn, both \\nthe complainant and respondent will be expected to demonstrate good faith efforts in \\ntheir participation with this process, particularly in relation to the scheduling of the \\nhearing. In a case involving exigent circumstances that prevent the complainant or \\nrespondent from participating in a scheduled hearing, the hearing will be rescheduled. 11. Every effort will be made to avoid conflicts with a student's class schedule when \\nidentifying a hearing date and time. When circumstances warrant, classroom \\nattendance, except for scheduled examinations, will not be a reasonable excuse for \\ndelaying a hearing. 12. In the rare circumstance where a respondent fails to make a good faith effort to \\nparticipate in the process, the university (having made reasonable attempts to \\naccommodate the respondent) may elect to schedule and conduct a hearing without \\nthat student's participation. 13. Review of incidents involving both community standards allegations and academic \\nintegrity allegations may be conducted by a University Disciplinary Committee at the \\ndiscretion of the dean of students or designee. 14. Allegations stemming from multiple incidents indicating an alleged pattern of behavior \\nmay be collectively reviewed by a single University Disciplinary Committee at the \\ndiscretion of the Resolution Review Board. 15. The respondent may file in writing counter-allegations against the complainant in \\nconnection with the incident(s) currently under review by the University Disciplinary \\nCommittee. In order to be considered for inclusion in the packet in the same hearing \\nprocess, counter-allegations must be raised within a reasonable time (normally two \\nbusiness days) of the first University Disciplinary Committee process advisement \\nmeeting. The counter-allegations must detail the university regulation or policy that the \\nrespondent believes has been violated in connection with the incident(s) currently under \\nreview by the University Disciplinary Committee and provide information that \\nsubstantiates the facts and circumstances. Counter-allegations cannot be based solely \\non the fact that a complaint was brought forward, nor can they be retaliatory in nature. The Resolution Review Board will determine if the counter-allegations will be reviewed \\n\", '281 \\n \\n \\nby the University Disciplinary Committee or resolved in a subsequent hearing, based on \\nthe connection of the counter- allegations to the incident(s) already under review. 16. Both the complainant and respondent have the right to have one Support Person of \\ntheir choosing present at the hearing. Both parties are required to notify the process \\nadvisor of their Support Person of choice at a date specified by the process advisor that \\nwill be at least three days in advance. If legal counsel will serve in this capacity, a \\nrepresentative of the University’s Office of General Counsel will typically be present for \\nthe hearing to provide assistance to the University Disciplinary Committee, moderator, \\nand/or process advisor as needed. Legal counsel or any other Support Person, if \\npresent, will not be permitted to participate in the proceedings but may advise the \\nrespondent or the complainant and/or be present at a hearing. In the event that one \\nparty to a case is accompanied by legal counsel without advance notice, a hearing may \\nbe postponed until all parties to the case have had an opportunity to have counsel \\npresent. Registered Support Persons are not permitted to participate as witnesses in the \\nsame hearing. 17. Both the complainant and respondent have the opportunity to register witnesses. Witnesses should be able to provide direct information related to the alleged violations \\nbeing reviewed by the University Disciplinary Committee, such as direct observation of \\nthe incident in question and/or direct interaction with any of the parties before, during \\nor after the incident in question. Both parties are required to notify the process advisor \\nof their registered witnesses at a date specified by the process advisor that will be at \\nleast three days in advance of the University Disciplinary Committee hearing. 18. The university reserves the right to supplement the registered witness list at any time to \\nensure that the board has access to all potential witnesses with substantive information. Both the Complainant and Respondent will be promptly notified of any changes to the \\nregistered witness list. 19. In scheduling a hearing, consideration should be given to allow that witnesses significant \\nto the case being heard are available to the hearing group. If a witness is not available to \\nbe called by the hearing group in person or via telecommunication, they may submit a \\nwritten statement to the process advisor to be reviewed if the board requests \\ninformation from the witness. ', '282 \\n \\n \\nHearing Process and Procedures \\n1. Information provided during a University Disciplinary Committee hearing should \\nremain private. 2. In order to maintain a fair and equitable process, no new materials will be accepted on \\nthe day of the hearing, with the exception of (i) oral testimony and (ii) such other \\ninformation as may be necessary to rebut new oral testimony. Information offered as \\nrebuttal will only be accepted at the discretion of the moderator. 3. All proceedings before a hearing group, except the deliberation of the group, will be \\nrecorded. Recordings will be kept in accordance with community standards records \\nretention practices. 4. During the actual hearing, a student has the right to be present when \\ninformation relative to the case is being presented. In the community standards process, \\na student who is charged with a violation has the right to remain silent. 5. The moderator will remind all persons present at the opening of each community \\nstandards hearing that the purpose of a University Disciplinary Committee is to \\ndetermine an appropriate response, through a deliberative process, when a violation \\nof policy, standard or regulation is alleged. 6. The complainant(s) and respondent(s) will each be limited to ten minutes for their \\nintroduction. 7. The majority of the proceeding will consist of questioning from the board members for \\nall parties as well as the registered witnesses that are called by the board. The \\ncomplainant(s) and respondent(s) will also have the opportunity to present questions for \\nthe board’s consideration. 8. It is within the discretion of the board to determine whether they wish to hear from \\nthe registered witnesses. Witnesses will be questioned one at a time by the hearing \\ngroup and subsequently dismissed. They should only be present in the room when \\nproviding information to the board. Except in documented extenuating \\ncircumstances, students are expected to make a good faith effort to provide \\ninformation to the University Disciplinary Committee when called as a witness. 9. The complainant(s) and respondent(s) will each be limited to five minutes for their \\nsummary. ', \"283 \\n \\n \\n10. All materials provided to the complainant(s) and respondent(s) (including those provided \\nelectronically) must be returned to the process advisor at the conclusion of the hearing. Copies of these materials may not be retained or used for any other purpose. 11. Following the complainant and respondent summary, the board will enter closed \\ndeliberations. A more likely than not standard (preponderance of the evidence) will \\nbe used to determine if a university policy, standard or regulation was violated. If \\nresponsibility is determined, the board will make a recommendation for appropriate \\noutcomes. 12. No information about a respondent's prior community standards record will be shared \\nwith the University Disciplinary Committee until a determination of responsibility has \\nbeen made unless the case being reviewed stems from the prior incident for which a \\ncommunity standards record exists. If a respondent(s) has a prior community standards \\nrecord and is found responsible by the University Disciplinary Committee, the following \\ninformation will be shared with the board: community standards violation(s) for which \\nthey were found responsible, date of incident(s), brief summary, outcome(s), and status \\nof the case(s). The student may be recalled before the board to discuss the prior \\nviolations and outcomes prior to the University Disciplinary Committee making a \\nrecommendation for appropriate outcomes for the present case. Hearing Outcome Determination and Notifications \\n16. A representative of the Office of Community Standards & Integrity will be responsible \\nfor notifying the associate vice president of student affairs for community life or \\ndesignee in writing of the recommendation of the hearing group regarding \\nresponsibility and any outcomes deemed appropriate. 17. The associate vice president of student affairs for community life or designee makes \\nthe decision in the case, informed by the recommendation of the University \\nDisciplinary Committee. The associate vice president of student affairs for \\ncommunity life or designee may accept, reject, or modify the recommendation, or \\nmay remand the matter to a new University Disciplinary Committee for review. 18. After reviewing the recommendations, the associate vice president of student affairs \\nfor community life or designee will render a decision in writing. The decision letter \\nwill typically be delivered to the respondent(s) by the process advisor. 19. In cases that involve a) crimes of violence and non-forcible sex offenses as defined by \\nthe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and b) sexual assault, dating \\n\", \"284 \\n \\n \\nviolence, domestic violence, and stalking in accordance with the Violence Against \\nWomen Act (VAWA), the complainant/ impacted party will receive notification of \\ndisposition of the allegation(s). 20. Parents of a student normally will not be notified of any community standards action. 21. Community standards actions will be recorded in the student's education record in the \\nOffice of Community Standards & Integrity in accordance with community standards \\nrecords retention practices. When community standards actions affect eligibility for \\nenrollment, designation on other university records will be made. Community standards \\nrecords will not be released as a part of the official transcript of the academic record of \\na student. Appeals \\nA request for appeal of a decision delivered through the University Disciplinary \\nCommittee process must be submitted in writing to the president of the university by the \\nrespondent within seven calendar days of the official notification of the decision. In cases where the disposition of the charge has been communicated to the complainant \\nand/or impacted party (as described above), the complainant and/or impacted party may \\nalso submit a request for appeal in writing to the president of the university within seven \\ncalendar days of the official notification of the decision. The written appeal request should indicate whether the student is appealing the finding(s) \\nof responsibility, the outcome(s), or both, as well as the basis for the appeal itself. The \\nbasis of an appeal will be limited to one or more of the following cases: \\n• A gross procedural error that materially affected the outcome; \\n• The outcome(s) imposed were not commensurate with the violation(s) of community \\nstandards for which the respondent(s) were found responsible; \\n• The finding was not consistent with a preponderance of the evidence; \\n• New information, which was unavailable at the time of the hearing, that merits re-\\nconsideration of the final disposition. The appeal officer designated by the president will review the written appeal request and \\ndetermine whether, in the judgment of the appeal officer, sufficient grounds exist for at \\nleast one basis of appeal to be further explored through review by the appeal officer. In \\nhearing an appeal, the appeal officer, at their discretion, may meet with individuals and \\nreview information relevant to the bases of the appeal. In the event of an appeal process, \\n\", '285 \\n \\n \\noutcomes will normally be held in abeyance pending the resolution of the appeal, except \\nin cases where the university determines there may exist a threat to the safety and \\nwelfare of the campus community, in which case outcomes will take immediate effect. Interim measures put in place via the Safety Intervention Protocol are not outcomes and \\ntherefore remain in effect per their original terms during the pendency of the appeal. Appeals will be decided by the appeal officer in a timely manner as circumstances \\nwarrant. While an appeal is under review, the appeal officer will update the respondent(s) \\nand complainant(s) as necessary about the anticipated timeline. The appeal officer has the authority to modify the decision as they deem appropriate for \\nresolution of the matter being appealed, which could entail an increase, decrease or \\nchange to the nature of the outcome(s). The appeal officer may also reconvene the initial \\nUniversity Disciplinary Committee or remand the matter to a new University Disciplinary \\nCommittee for review. Cases Involving Prohibited Conduct Under Section VI.E of the Sexual Misconduct \\nPolicy (Interim) \\nAlleged violations of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) that meet the definition of \\nFederal Rule Sexual Misconduct will be resolved in accordance with the Hearing \\nProcedures for the Adjudication of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct set forth in Section \\nVI.C of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim). Cases involving Other Prohibited Conduct \\nwith student respondents under section VI.E of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) will \\nbe resolved in accordance with the Community Standards process subject to the following \\nadditional procedures. 1. In cases where the university receives information describing behaviors that may \\nviolate the university Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) and the impacted party \\nchooses not to serve as a complainant in a community standards proceeding, the \\nuniversity may act as a complainant when there exists a broader or overriding \\ncommunity interest. Notwithstanding the fact that the impacted party wishes not to \\nserve as complainant, they may nevertheless act as a witness in a University \\nDisciplinary Committee hearing. 2. For all Prohibited Conduct, students may utilize alternative resolution options for \\ntheir complaint as set forth in Section VI.G of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim). 3. In cases involving alleged violations of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim), the \\nuniversity will register the appropriate university investigator(s) to serve as potential \\nwitnesses during a University Disciplinary Committee hearing. ', '286 \\n \\n \\n4. Expert witnesses may testify before the University Disciplinary Committee only as \\nspecified in Appendix B of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim). 5. In general, new information will not be added to the investigative report under VI.B of \\nthe Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim). The Process Advisor has discretion to allow \\nnew documentary evidence prior to a hearing or to remand the matter back to the \\ninvestigator for further investigation. 6. In cases that involve a) crimes of violence and non-forcible sex offenses as defined by \\nthe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and b) sexual assault, dating \\nviolence, domestic violence, and stalking in accordance with the Violence Against \\nWomen Act (VAWA), the complainant/impacted party will receive notification of \\ndisposition of the allegation(s) and has the right to submit an appeal following \\nnotification of the disposition of a complaint resolved by a University Disciplinary \\nCommittee. 7. After reviewing the recommendations, the associate vice president of student affairs \\nfor community life or designee will notify the respondent in writing of their decision \\nas well as the process for appeal. Notifications to the complainant/impacted party in \\ncases that involve a) crimes of violence and non-forcible sex offenses as defined by \\nthe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and b) sexual assault, dating \\nviolence, domestic violence, and stalking in accordance with the Violence Against \\nWomen Act (VAWA) will be made in writing by the process advisor and will include \\nnotification of the appeal process. 8. Administrative resolution meetings and University Disciplinary Committee hearings \\nwill be conducted by officials who receive annual training on the issues related to all \\nProhibited Conduct on how to conduct an investigation and hearing process that \\nprotects the safety of all involved while promoting accountability and a fair process. Cases Involving Student Organizations \\nCarnegie Mellon University is committed to managing all cases that involve alleged \\nviolations of university policy by student organizations with appropriate care and \\nsensitivity. In these cases, the university may need to invoke additional procedural \\nprovisions to determine responsibility for alleged policy violation(s) by a student \\norganization. Recognized student organizations include groups that are given recognition \\nby a college, department or governing body on campus. Recognized student organizations \\nhave certain privileges and use of campus resources (e.g. funding (university or student \\n', '287 \\n \\n \\nfees), use of designated spaces, participation in campus activities, ability to utilize \\nuniversity systems, etc). In cases of alleged policy violations in which the responding party is a student \\norganization, the following procedures will supplement the procedures outlined in the \\nConduct of University Disciplinary Committee Hearings: \\n1. In cases where the university receives information describing behaviors that may \\nviolate university policy and the impacted party chooses not to serve as a \\ncomplainant in a community standards proceeding, the university may act as a \\ncomplainant when there exists a broader or overriding community interest. Notwithstanding the fact that the impacted party wishes not to serve as complainant, \\nthey may nevertheless act as a witness in a University Disciplinary Committee \\nhearing. 2. In cases where the university receives information describing behaviors that may \\nviolate university policy, the university reserves the right to temporarily restrict any \\nand all activities and operations of the organization while the case is being \\ninvestigated and/or resolved through the appropriate process. 3. For purposes of organizational conduct, separation from the university may be \\ndefined as temporary or permanent loss of recognition along with associated \\nprivileges. 4. No more than two student members may represent an organization in a community \\nstandards proceeding. 5. The University Disciplinary Committee may review both individual member and \\norganizational allegations concurrently. It is recommended that members \\nresponding to individual allegations do not also represent the organization in the \\nsame University Disciplinary Committee. 6. A preponderance of the evidence standard (e.g., more likely than not) will be used to \\ndetermine if a university policy, standard, or regulation has been violated. 7. Administrative resolution meetings will be conducted by the SLICE representative or \\ndesignee for alleged violations of community standards by an organization. Should \\nadministrative resolution fail, the matter will be remanded to the Office of \\nCommunity Standards & Integrity for resolution. 8. The complaining party and each designated student representative is entitled to a \\ncopy of the board packet before the hearing. ', '288 \\n \\n \\n9. The university is committed to resolving cases related to organizational conduct in a \\ntimely manner. Complainants and respondents will receive periodic status updates \\nrelated to the timeline for resolution of the case. 10. The university reserves the right to share periodic updates related to process, \\ntimeline, findings, and resolution of the case with appropriate parties including \\norganization advisors, the sponsoring academic unit, (inter)national organization \\nheadquarters, and/or recognizing body (e.g. Student Government or appropriate \\nGoverning Councils), etc. 11. Unless a different timeline is set forth in this section, stated timelines for a University \\nDisciplinary Committee hearing and notification of a decision will be followed in \\ncases involving student organizations. 12. Upon a finding of responsibility, the University Disciplinary Committee or \\nadjudicator will be provided with the student organization’s prior community \\nstandards violations (four years prior) for consideration when determining outcomes. The student organization representatives may be recalled before the board to \\ndiscuss the prior violations and outcomes prior to the University Disciplinary \\nCommittee making a recommendation for appropriate outcomes for the present \\ncase. The complainant may be recalled with the student organization \\nrepresentatives. 13. The University Disciplinary Committee may recommend as an outcome of the \\norganizational review, that an individual or individuals be charged with specific policy \\nviolations to be reviewed via a subsequent community standards process. 14. In cases that involve student organizations, complaints will be considered for a \\nperiod of four years following the date of the most recent allegation. Complaints \\nreceived more than two years following the date of the most recent allegation may \\nbe reviewed upon the approval of the Associate Vice President for Community \\nStandards and Diversity Initiatives. 15. In cases that involve student organizations, the complainant will receive notification \\nof disposition of the allegation(s) to the degree that individual privacy is not \\nimpacted. 16. After reviewing the recommendations, the associate vice president of student affairs \\nfor community life or designee will render a decision in writing. The decision letter \\nwill typically be delivered to the respondent(s) by the process advisor. ', '289 \\n \\n \\n17. Appeals will be decided by the appeal officer in a timely manner as circumstances \\nwarrant. While an appeal is under review, the appeal officer will update the \\nrespondent and complainant as necessary about the anticipated timeline. The \\ncomplainant and respondent will be notified in writing of the final decision.', '18. Consistent with Pennsylvania state law, the university will issue and electronically \\npublish a biannual report of all reported hazing violations. Biannual hazing reports \\nare retained for at least five years. 19. Community standards records of student organizations are retained for a period of \\nseven years following the conclusion of the resolution process. The record may \\nbe maintained indefinitely if a student organization has not fulfilled all outcomes or \\nhas not resolved pending community standards allegations. Records of community \\nstandards processes that result in the temporary loss of recognition from the \\nuniversity will be maintained for a period of seven years after the organization \\nreceives recognition once the suspension period has concluded. Records of \\ncommunity standards processes that result in the permanent loss of recognition \\nfrom the university will be maintained indefinitely. Outcomes \\nThe community standards outcomes defined below comprise a range of official action that \\nmay be imposed by the University for violations of community standards. One or more of \\nthese actions may be imposed in response to a given situation. This list is not comprehensive, \\nas other outcomes may be utilized as appropriate. When outcomes are decided as part of the community standards process, the educational \\nand developmental needs of the involved student and the welfare of the community will be \\nconsidered with utmost importance. The outcomes categories (i.e. student status, restorative \\nand restrictive) are intended to clarify the role and purpose of the various actions. The \\ndetermination of outcomes will be guided by the following considerations: the interests of \\nthe community, the impact of the violation, documented community standards history, and \\nany mitigating or aggravating circumstances. Non-compliance with imposed or agreed-upon outcomes may result in further action \\nthrough the community standards process. Students with two (2) community standards \\nviolations within and academic year may immediately be placed in disciplinary probation. Student involved in three (3) violation within an academic year may be referred to the \\nUniversity Disciplinary Committee. ', '290 \\n \\n \\nOutcomes Related to Student Standing \\nThese outcomes clarify the student’s standing with the University. Additional violations of \\ncommunity standards may result in more severe outcomes including separation from the \\nUniversity. • Warning: For minor infractions, a student may be issued a written warning. The \\nwarning will be noted in the event of any further infractions of community standards \\nand may justify consideration of more severe outcomes. While a warning may \\ninfluence future actions related to student standing, a warning alone does not affect \\nstudent standing. • Residential Probation: An official notice to a residential student that conduct with \\nregard to university housing regulations or policies has been unacceptable and that \\nfuture violation of university regulations may result in more serious community \\nstandards action, including the possible loss of campus residency. Probation lasts for a \\nstated period of time. • Disciplinary Probation: For a second infraction or for a single offense of a more serious \\nnature, a student may be placed on disciplinary probation for a designated period of \\ntime, during which subsequent community standards violations may result in \\nsuspension or expulsion. A student on probation is still considered to be in good \\nstanding with the university. • Disciplinary Suspension: A student may be barred from enrollment for a designated \\nperiod of time. Students who have been suspended are required to absent themselves \\nfrom the campus (including but not limited to university housing, fraternity or sorority \\nhouses, offices, labs, and libraries) within a maximum of two days after the action and \\nto remain off the campus for the duration of the time specified as outlined in the \\nPolicy on Student Suspension/Required Withdrawal. A student on disciplinary \\nsuspension is not eligible to register for courses, attend classes, live in university \\nhousing, use campus facilities, be on university property, participate in student \\nactivities, be an active member of a student organization, or be employed by the \\nuniversity during the period of suspension. • Expulsion: The student is required to sever entirely their connection with the \\nuniversity. Students who have been expelled are required to absent themselves from \\nuniversity property (including but not limited to university housing, fraternity or \\nsorority houses, offices, labs, and libraries) within a maximum of two days after the \\n', '291 \\n \\n \\naction and to remain off the campus permanently. Students who have been expelled \\nfrom the university may not apply for admission to other academic programs at the \\nuniversity. Restorative Outcomes \\nThese outcomes require the student to take action to repair the harm their behavior \\ncaused or to utilize university resources to support their continued engagement in the \\ncommunity. Failure to complete these outcomes by the specified deadline may result in \\nadditional community standards action. • Behavioral Assessments and Recommendations: The University may require a student \\nto meet with a health care provider and/or a mental health care provider within a \\nspecified time frame. If so, the student will be expected to fully participate in any \\nrelevant assessment requested by the provider and complete any consequent \\nrecommendation(s), such as a treatment plan or a referral to another provider. The \\nstudent is expected to provide the appropriate releases to allow the university to \\nconfirm compliance with this outcome. • Community Service: The University may require uncompensated service (a specified \\nnumber of hours) to the university or an off-campus, non-profit organization as an \\noutcome. The particular assignment of duties must be pre- approved through the \\nappropriate university adjudicator. Students must provide appropriate documentation \\nverifying their completed community service. Failure to complete the service \\nsatisfactorily within the specified period of time may result in further action through \\nthe community standards process. • Educational/Developmental Assignment: The University may require a student to \\ncomplete a project, assignment, or activity to promote the student’s education and \\ndevelopment. These assignments are at the discretion of the university adjudicator or \\nUniversity Disciplinary Committee. Assignments may include but are not limited to: \\nreflection or research paper, development of a presentation, discussion with an \\nindividual, apology letter, reading assignment, etc. • Restitution: In cases where a student is found responsible for damaging or \\nmisappropriating physical property, the student may be responsible for reimbursing \\nthe property owner for all or some of the cost. In limited circumstances when a complaint was filed prior to the respondent’s degree \\nconferral, the dean of students or designee may consider the following outcomes: \\n', '292 \\n \\n \\n• Suspension of a conferred degree: A previously conferred degree is being suspended and \\nthe transcript will no longer reflect a completed degree. The degree will remain \\nsuspended until the time specified and any pending outcomes are completed. During the \\nduration of the degree suspension, the individual is prohibited from: representing that \\nthey have obtained a degree from Carnegie Mellon University; enrolling at Carnegie \\nMellon University; being present on University property; or participating in any Carnegie \\nMellon University sponsored events or activities, including alumni events. • Revocation of a conferred degree: A previously conferred degree is being revoked and the \\ntranscript will no longer reflect a completed degree. The individual is prohibited from: \\nrepresenting that they have obtained a degree from Carnegie Mellon University; enrolling \\nat Carnegie Mellon University in the future; being present on University property; or \\nparticipating in any Carnegie Mellon University sponsored events or activities, including \\nalumni events. Restrictive Outcomes \\nThese outcomes prevent a student from engaging in certain activities, being present in \\ncertain spaces or engaging with individuals during a specific time period. Violation of a \\nrestriction may lead to additional community standards action. • Loss of Privilege: Students may lose specified privileges, which may include access to \\nfacilities, services, and/or the opportunity to participate in university activities. • Loss of Residency in University Housing: An action that excludes a student or student \\ngroup from residence in university housing for a stated period of time. A student who \\nloses residency in university housing shall be considered for future housing \\naccommodations once the period of debarment is concluded and as space permits. • No Contact Order: A No Contact Order is a directive from an associate vice president of \\nstudent affairs or designee indicating that two students may not have direct contact \\nwith each other, or make indirect contact through third parties, except for that which is \\nnecessary for their academic pursuits. A No Contact Order may be issued in \\nconnection with the community standards process, either as an interim measure \\nduring the pendency of the process and/or an outcome associated with a finding of \\nresponsibility from the process. • Room Reassignment: An action where a student is assigned to either another room in \\nthe same house community or a room in another house community. When a student \\nis assigned to another house community, specific restrictions concerning the previous \\ncommunity may be invoked. ', \"293 \\n \\n \\nWithholding a Degree \\nBecause a degree from the university signifies not only successful completion of academic \\nrequirements but also compliance with the university’s standards and good standing as a \\nmember of the university community, the dean of students or designee may direct that a \\ndegree not be certified by the university registrar and therefore not awarded pending the \\nresolution of community standards proceedings, including completion of all outcomes. Citations \\nState citations are issued by University Police for violations of state law. While these \\ncitations are handled through the criminal justice system, students may also be expected to \\nmeet with a university adjudicator to determine whether a violation of community standards \\nhas also occurred. Withdrawal with Pending Allegations \\nStudents who withdraw from the university with unresolved community standards \\nallegations should expect the university to adjudicate the matter to bring the case to \\nresolution and uphold the university’s obligation to expressly articulate eligibility to return to \\nthe university. If a good faith effort to participate in the appropriate process is not exhibited \\nby the respondent, the university may elect to resolve the matter through the community \\nstandards process without that student's participation. Review After a Charge or Conviction of a Crime \\nIn circumstances that constitute a potential threat to the safety and security of the university \\ncommunity and/or to the university’s ability to function in whole or in part, the university may \\nreview a case when a student has been charged with or convicted of any felony or \\nmisdemeanor crime(s) in federal, state, or local court or an equivalent foreign court. The \\nreview will be conducted utilizing the university's community standards process and/or \\nSafety Intervention Protocol. Examples of crimes that may trigger such review include but are not limited to: \\n• Aggravated assault \\n• Arson \\n• Burglary \\n\", '294 \\n \\n \\n• Child abuse \\n• Criminal mischief \\n• Hazing \\n• Murder or manslaughter \\n• Rape \\n• Robbery \\n• Sexual assault \\n• Theft \\n• The manufacturing, selling or possessing with intent to sell any drug on the prescribed \\nlist subject to the criminal code of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \\nCommunity Standards Records Retention and Reporting \\nRecords of community standards proceedings are confidential and are not released without the \\nconsent of the current/former student or as otherwise required or authorized by law or court \\norder. With the exceptions as noted below, records of community standards proceedings are \\nretained for either the period of time required under the federal Clery Act (which in most cases \\nis six to seven years after the date the incident was reported to the university), or three years \\nafter final separation of the student from the university, whichever is longer. For purposes of \\ndetermining final separation from the university, a student must be separated for three \\ncontinuous years. If a student re-enrolls in any student program within three years, the \\ncalculation of the final separation date will reset. Consistent with the Student Privacy Rights Policy, for purposes of community standards record \\nchecks, information from these records is only provided, with appropriate authorization as \\nnecessary, for three years after final separation from the university (as defined above) provided \\nthe student has fulfilled all obligations to the university.

under the laws of the Commonwealth of \\nPennsylvania.\\n\\nIts first purpose, as stated in its Articles of Incorporation, is: \\n\"...the establishment and maintenance in the City of Pittsburgh of a coeducational university of \\nhigher education, including an institute of technology, emphasizing liberal-professional \\neducation and specializing in teaching and research programs in selected areas of importance to \\nthe community and to the nation.\"\\n\\nMore specifically, Carnegie Mellon seeks to provide education of the highest quality so that all \\nstudents will be prepared to achieve their potential as professional persons and as thoughtful, \\nwell-informed individuals.', 'In addition, the university encourages and supports scholarship, \\nresearch and artistic production, both as essential components of its educational program and \\nin fulfillment of the special role of an academic institution as a source of new knowledge and \\nunderstanding.\\n\\nThrough scholarship, research and the men and women it educates, the \\nuniversity contributes to social progress.\\n\\nAs a private university, Carnegie Mellon is free to set its own measures of excellence and to \\ndetermine its own educational objectives.\\n\\nBy carefully exercising the freedom to select limited \\nareas for university effort, it can preserve its ability to be innovative and creative in response to \\nthe changing needs of society.\\n\\nIn order to maintain this independence and flexibility, Carnegie \\nMellon depends upon the voluntary support of the society which it serves.\\n\\nIt depends especially \\nfor its funds upon students and their families, alumni, trustees, foundations, corporations, \\ngovernment and friends.', 'It depends especially \\nfor its funds upon students and their families, alumni, trustees, foundations, corporations, \\ngovernment and friends.\\n\\nThus, it is of the utmost importance that the goals of the university be \\nclear and that the standards and procedures for the conduct of its affairs be well understood by \\nall of its constituents, both on and off campus.\\n\\nThese appear in detail in the duly promulgated \\nregulations of the university, particularly in the catalogs, the Student Handbook and the Faculty \\nHandbook.\\n\\nAcademic and Individual Freedom \\nWithin the academic community, trustees, administrators, faculty, students and staff share the \\nresponsibility for achievement of the goals of the university.\\n\\nResponsibilities specific to various \\ngroups are discussed in the sections which follow.\\n\\nEspecially important, however, are the \\nresponsibilities pertaining to academic and individual freedom.', 'Responsibilities specific to various \\ngroups are discussed in the sections which follow.\\n\\nEspecially important, however, are the \\nresponsibilities pertaining to academic and individual freedom.\\n\\nAn academic community is \\nuniquely suited to its educational and scholarly purposes primarily because of its firm \\ncommitment to intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry and expression, respect for the dignity \\nof each individual and because of its receptiveness to constructive change.', '10 \\n \\n \\nThe commitment to academic and individual freedom carries with it major responsibilities for all \\nmembers of the university.\\n\\nIn

who will serve \\nsociety with integrity.\\n\\nThe university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and \\nexpressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society.\", 'The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and \\nexpressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society.\\n\\nCarnegie Mellon strives to serve the \\nchanging needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: \\nto create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, \\nteaching and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching them leadership \\nand problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society \\nand commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open \\nto the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish.\\n\\nThese statements provide groundwork for academic integrity that includes everyone in the \\nCarnegie Mellon community.\\n\\nOur common objective is to make sure that we teach and learn \\nwith commitment, consistency, honesty and fidelity.', 'Our common objective is to make sure that we teach and learn \\nwith commitment, consistency, honesty and fidelity.\\n\\nThis process involves at its core \\ninteraction between young and old, novice and expert, apprentice and master.\\n\\nIntegrity \\nrequires that we examine the context in which we do our work.\\n\\nIn the university community, \\nyoung people grow and develop their identities, which mandate that all our dealings follow \\nand foster principles of respect for autonomy, beneficence, justice and fidelity to the mission \\nof the university.\\n\\nThe university population is increasingly diverse, faces rapid changes in \\nknowledge and technology that have historically produced uncertainty about the appropriate \\nroles of individuals and professions in the larger society.\\n\\nEach of these facts can and do \\ncreate issues that we need to be aware of and deal with if we are to successfully achieve our \\nprimary missions.', 'Each of these facts can and do \\ncreate issues that we need to be aware of and deal with if we are to successfully achieve our \\nprimary missions.\\n\\nWhen these circumstances are not fully communicated to and understood \\nby all persons in the community, unnecessary suspicions concerning integrity may distract \\nfrom our teaching and learning and taint the atmosphere on campus.\\n\\nWhen they are openly \\ndiscussed and conflicts concerning them openly aired, we all proceed with greater confidence \\nand trust.\\n\\nAll members of the university community have the obligation to serve as models of personal \\nand professional integrity, as well as models for creating, expressing and transferring \\nknowledge.\\n\\nThis implies that the faculty not only provide the knowledge and training that \\nprepare students to find their productive roles in society, but also help them discover and \\nmaintain integrity in the practice of that role.', 'Staff and administrators are charged with \\nrepresenting the university accurately and forthrightly.\\n\\nStudents are responsible for', '13 \\n \\n \\nconducting their learning in a similarly honest and committed fashion-by avoiding plagiarism, \\ncheating or taking credit for work not their own-and thus contributing to a campus \\natmosphere which expects and supports academic integrity.\\n\\nPractice of the Mission of Academic Integrity \\nAcademic integrity refers to the implicit commitment that every member makes to all others \\nin the community to practice those principles that underlie the mission of the university and \\ndefine academic integrity.\\n\\nThese are: honesty and good faith; clarity in the communication of \\ncore values; professional conduct of work; mutual trust and respect; and fairness and \\nexemplary behavior.\\n\\nHonesty and Good Faith \\nUnderlying all the interactions and transactions of the university is the assumption that all of \\nits members act in good faith and are open with each other.\\n\\nFor example, students must be \\nable to assume that they can take faculty, staff and administration at their word and vice \\nversa.', \"For example, students must be \\nable to assume that they can take faculty, staff and administration at their word and vice \\nversa.\\n\\nIf questions about honest communications and good faith arise within the community \\nor among some of its members, the general issue must be aired in a frank and open way.\\n\\nIndividual cases involving alleged infractions, on the other hand, are properly handled under \\nconditions that respect confidentiality.\\n\\nPenalties for proven infractions of the university's \\nstandards must be dealt with promptly and fairly.\\n\\nThe more fully we can come to understand \\nand concur with one another on guiding principles, the fewer such cases will turn up, and the \\nmore rewarding the university experience will be for all of us.\", 'The more fully we can come to understand \\nand concur with one another on guiding principles, the fewer such cases will turn up, and the \\nmore rewarding the university experience will be for all of us.\\n\\nClarity in the Communication of Core Values \\nClarity in the communication of the core values and standards of Carnegie Mellon requires \\nexplicit understanding of the mission and core values among members of faculty, staff, \\nadministration and students; reflection upon and open discussion of standards of practice; \\nidentification and resolution of conflicts posed by our mission objectives; and a clear and \\nopen communication of our mission to the community.\\n\\nThis means we recognize our \\ncommitment to the distinct objectives of our vision and mission with all the assessment, \\ncertification, evaluation and reorientation that these imply.\\n\\nIn direct face-to-face situations \\nstudents should be dealt with immediately, openly and honestly.', 'In direct face-to-face situations \\nstudents should be dealt with immediately, openly and honestly.\\n\\nStudents also need \\nopportunities to learn about and discuss standards, expectations and norms when no \\nimmediate \"case\" is at hand.', \"14 \\n \\n \\nProfessional Conduct of Work \\nProfessionalism for the faculty involves designing syllabi which accurately indicate the subject \\nmatter and practices of each course and meeting all scheduled classes fully prepared for the \\nassigned work.\\n\\nIt also involves the certification of students in their areas of expertise.\\n\\nThe \\nuniversity is obligated to provide measures of student progress in the form of grades, \\ndegrees, and honors.\\n\\nThese attest to society that both faculty and students have fulfilled their \\ncommitments.\\n\\nDegrees and honors certify that a level of performance has been met in a \\nstudent's demonstration of acquisition and use of knowledge, so it is imperative that grading \\nbe a fair, accurate and honest measure of a student's work.\", 'At the same time, faculty need to \\nbe cognizant of the pressure on students to view grades, which they see as determining their \\njob prospects, as \"the be all and end all\" of their university experiences and to devise \\nstrategies in the classroom to make learning, rather than receiving grades, the central focus.\\n\\nThe ethics governing research must be understood, practiced and communicated to \\nstudents.\\n\\nThis involves being clear and truthful about the ownership of research results and \\ndata, avoiding conflicts of interest (or disclosing them when they cannot be avoided), and \\nmaking only honest and accurate claims in reporting research.\\n\\nIn the context of the \\nuniversity, the professional conduct of work has two distinct dimensions: professionalism in \\none\\'s discipline or area of expertise and professionalism as a member of the university.\\n\\nThe \\ndistinction between these aspects of professionalism in the academy must be clearly \\nunderstood and communicated.', \"The \\ndistinction between these aspects of professionalism in the academy must be clearly \\nunderstood and communicated.\\n\\nIn addition, each of the various academic disciplines and \\nfields of endeavor represented at Carnegie Mellon has its own implicit and explicit standards \\nfor professional work.\\n\\nThese are binding on faculty, administration and staff, and must be \\ncommunicated to students as part of their preparation to become professionals.\\n\\nResearch \\nethics also entails the open discussion of the propriety of the university's involvement in \\nwork that seems to be detrimental to society given the values of our mission.\\n\\nProfessional research in the academy is involved with several of its unique institutional goals, \\nincluding the education of undergraduates, graduate education and certification for \\nprofessional roles, and faculty tenure.\", 'These features pose issues specific to the academy, \\nissues which must be acknowledged and treated explicitly if we are to be clear, open and \\nconsistent.\\n\\nThe practices of other organizations may therefore not be entirely relevant to \\nthose in the university.\\n\\nRecognizing that students are learners demands that they be involved \\nin ongoing research in ways which benefit their education, rather than merely as assistants in \\nfaculty projects.\\n\\nStudents need also to be clearly informed about standards of behavior and \\nperformance that are accepted practices in the discipline and held responsible to them.\\n\\nThis \\nshould be done proactively as a learning experience rather than retroactively as a punitive \\nexperience.', \"15 \\n \\n \\nMutual Trust and Respect \\nAn environment of mutual trust and respect is necessary if the institution is to promote \\nintegrity.\\n\\nMutual trust and respect are prerequisites for open communication and honest \\ndialogue about values, goals and expectations.\\n\\nThey require freedom of expression without \\nfear of retribution, institutional or otherwise, and value the diversity of persons, ideas and \\nchoices differing from one's own.\\n\\nThey recognize that being in a diverse community is an \\nadvantage to encouraging discovery and creativity.\\n\\nBoth respect for individuals and respect \\nfor institutional values involves balancing the claims of personal autonomy with the goals \\nand mission of the institution.\\n\\nAll of us need to be alert to prevent the power structure of the \\nclassroom and the university as a whole from suppressing legitimate beliefs and practices.\", \"All of us need to be alert to prevent the power structure of the \\nclassroom and the university as a whole from suppressing legitimate beliefs and practices.\\n\\nIf \\ntrust should break down, we need to explore the reasons for the breakdown and identify \\nways for the community to rebuild trust among its members.\\n\\nA basis for promoting trust and respect is provided by ensuring that the faculty treat the \\nstudent's education and the student as ends rather than as a means to some end.\\n\\nFor \\nexample, the graduate student's development as a researcher and professional, his or her \\nlearning and well-being, have to be honored as ends in themselves, rather than treating \\ngraduate student work merely as a means to the end of the production of knowledge (from \\nwhich the professor may benefit more than the student).\\n\\nStudents at all levels must be \\nencouraged to value their university experience as learning and personal growth, rather than \\nsolely as the means to a career goal.\", \"Students at all levels must be \\nencouraged to value their university experience as learning and personal growth, rather

\\nthe university's standards.\\n\\nFairness and Exemplary Behavior \\nThe preservation of academic integrity means not only commitment to ideals but also justice \\nin carrying out these ideals.\\n\\nFaculty, staff and administration must deal fairly in all of the \\nvarious decisions they make which have consequences for students and all the other \\nstakeholders of the university.\\n\\nWhen questions arise as to whether such decisions distribute \\nbenefits and burdens fairly, significant dialogue and open communications about such \\ndecisions should be conducted.\", 'When questions arise as to whether such decisions distribute \\nbenefits and burdens fairly, significant dialogue and open communications about such \\ndecisions should be

access.\\n\\nExamples include excessive use of CPU time during a period \\nof heavy use on a timesharing system, excessive use of disk space on a system that does \\nnot limit such utilization, the use of an excessive amount of network bandwidth in an \\nenvironment of networked computers, and any activity that makes a system unusable or \\nsignificantly degrades performance for others.', 'A novice user might be unaware that a \\nparticular action constitutes “excessive use” but, without doubt, once a system \\nadministrator makes him or her aware of the fact that such an action is unreasonable, \\nthat user will be held responsible for any further such infractions.\\n\\nIf you are unsure \\nwhether your needs constitute excessive use, contact the system administrator.\\n\\nSimilarly, \\nif you need an unusual amount of disk space, CPU time or other resources, check with the \\nsystem administrator to find out whether this use can be accommodated,

in the process.\\n\\nPersonal Use  \\nWhile the university makes computer resources available primarily to achieve its goals of \\neducation and research, and for administrative activities, it

\\ndepartment head or specified designee.\\n\\nDepartments cannot assume that someone is \\na native speaker without talking with him or her.\\n\\n• The fluency of non-native English speaking faculty members will be evaluated through \\ntwo interviews: one with the dean, department head or specified designee, and the \\nsecond with a senior faculty member.\\n\\nAll interviewers must be native speakers of \\nEnglish.\\n\\n• TA English fluency — both graduate and undergraduate — is managed through the \\nInternational Teaching Assistant testing process administered by CMU's Intercultural \\nCommunication Center.\", \"• TA English fluency — both graduate and undergraduate — is managed through the \\nInternational Teaching Assistant testing process administered by CMU's Intercultural

law, CMU allows for the following exemptions from \\ncertification: 1) visiting faculty, 2) faculty who will teach courses taught predominantly \\nin a foreign language, 3) faculty who do not teach undergraduate students, and 4) \\nfaculty who work one-on-one with students.\\n\\n(Note: CMU requires TAs to take the ITA for any job that requires student interaction.)\", '42 \\n \\n \\nExaminations

\\nsemester and at mid-semester.\\n\\nThere should be no expectation that the following points \\nwill cover every conceivable situation.\\n\\nThe student should anticipate the demands of the \\nexam schedule, plan accordingly and early, and be prepared.', 'The student should anticipate the demands of the \\nexam schedule, plan accordingly and early, and be prepared.\\n\\nThe faculty should recognize \\nthat the student is encumbered with many tightly orchestrated and intensive obligations \\nduring this period over which he or she has no control: expectations should be reasonably \\nconsistent with the number of course units and, of course, should be made known to the \\nstudent well in advance of the final examination period, preferably as part of the course \\nsyllabus.\\n\\nIn order to help students plan their time and study optimally for examinations, this \\ndocument lays out in some detail the policies regarding final and in-term

Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a \\nwhole.\\n\\n• Minimal copying does not trigger infringement liability and thus does not require fair \\nuse analysis.', '• Minimal copying does not trigger infringement liability and thus does not require fair \\nuse analysis.\\n\\n• The extent of permissible copying under fair use varies with the purpose and \\ncharacter of the use.\\n\\n8 This guidance contains citations to some more recent court decisions.\\n\\nFor the sake of brevity not all legal principles in this \\nguidance contain citations.\\n\\nPlease contact the Office of the General Counsel if you have any questions regarding this guidance.', '48 \\n \\n \\n• Copying an entire work may be permissible if necessary to achieve a legitimate \\npurpose.\\n\\nFor example, the copying of entire works did not weight against fair use \\nwhen necessary for the purpose of providing access to the print disabled or \\nproviding a search index to complete works.\\n\\n• Copying of a quantitatively small portion of a work can weigh against fair use if the \\nportion used is \"the heart\" of the work.\\n\\n• The inclusion of one chapter of a book in electronic course reserves did not weigh \\nagainst fair use even when the publisher made available licenses for digital excerpts.\\n\\nD. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\\n\\n• Although in the past this factor was considered to be the most important in the fair \\nuse analysis, this no longer is true.\\n\\n• Courts examine whether the secondary use usurps the market for the original work.', '• Courts examine whether the secondary use usurps the market for the original work.\\n\\n• With respect to impact on potential licensing revenue, courts look at \"traditional, \\nreasonable, or likely to be developed markets.\"\\n\\n• Markets for transformative uses are not traditional markets; hence, a transformative \\nuse does not impair the market for purposes of this factor.\\n\\n• Even when a court concluded a use was non-transformative, it considered the \\nadverse impact on a licensing market only if the license was easily accessible, \\nreasonably priced, and available for the portion and format the user sought to use.\\n\\nE. Good Faith of User \\n• Some courts have identified a fifth, non-statutory factor: whether the user acted in \\ngood faith.\\n\\n• This factor should typically weigh in favor of nonprofit educational uses.\\n\\n• Documentation of the user\\'s fair use analysis, such as a fair use checklist or a \\nstatement of pedagogical need, demonstrates the user\\'s good faith.', \"• Documentation of the user's fair use analysis, such as a fair use checklist or a \\nstatement of pedagogical need, demonstrates the user's good faith.\\n\\nAlthough copyright law generally does not require a user to attribute the source of \\nmaterial, such attribution demonstrates the user's good faith.\\n\\n(Attribution often also is \\nrequired as a matter of academic ethics as well as the terms of a Creative Commons \\nlicense.)\\n\\nIn addition, courts have treated as fair use:\", \"49 \\n \\n \\n• Copying incidental to the streaming of films assigned for courses [9]; \\n• Inclusion of chapters of monographs (but not textbooks) in electronic course reserves [10]; \\nand \\n• Mass digitization of books for the purpose of preservation, creating a search index, and \\nproviding access to the print disabled.\\n\\n[11] \\nWhen considering similar uses, members of the University community should treat these \\ndecisions as important guideposts.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nBest Practices \\nSeveral educational communities have developed codes of best practices in fair use.\\n\\n[12] \\nThese codes each represent a community's consensus about acceptable practices for the \\nfair use of copyrighted materials.\\n\\nLegal scholarship has demonstrated that courts give \\nweight to what a relevant community considers to be acceptable practice.\\n\\nWhen \\nexercising the fair use doctrine, members of the University community should consult and \\nfollow the appropriate code of best practices.\", \"When \\nexercising the fair use doctrine, members of the University community should consult and \\nfollow the appropriate code of best practices.\\n\\nIn particular, the Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Academic and Research Libraries (see \\nlink below) articulates a set of principles for how fair use applies to certain common \\npractices in the university setting.\\n\\nThe Code sets forth limitations that should be observed \\nto assure that the case for fair use is strong, and enhancements that could further \\nstrengthen that case.\\n\\nThese principles include that it is fair use to: \\n• Make appropriately tailored course-related content available to enrolled students via \\ndigital networks; \\n• Make digital copies for purposes of preservation, and to make these copies available \\nas surrogates for fragile and inaccessible materials; \\n• Create digital versions of a library's special collections and to make these versions \\nelectronically accessible in appropriate contexts; \\n \\n9 Association for Info.\", \"Media and Equip.\\n\\nv.

to do research that may be difficult or impossible without restrictions or \\nwithout access to classified or proprietary materials.\\n\\nThere exists, therefore, a tension between the university's goal of disseminating \\nknowledge freely and the desire on the part of some of its members to conduct restricted \\nresearch on important problems.\\n\\nThe university intends to guarantee the academic \\nfreedom of all faculty members to do research in their own manner on topics of their own \\nchoosing, provided that such research is consistent with the overall purposes of the \\nuniversity.\", 'This policy seeks to resolve the tension between the desire to participate in restricted \\nresearch and the desire to maintain the open atmosphere of the university by confining \\nrestricted research to semi-autonomous units, which are not associated with any \\nacademic departments.\\n\\nIt thereby establishes the principle that restricted research is \\ninappropriate at Carnegie Mellon University except in the semi-autonomous units.\\n\\nThis policy does not attempt to anticipate all possible concerns about restricted research.\\n\\nIn some cases, decisions will need to be made about particular research projects to which \\nthe application of particular policy guidelines are not clear.\\n\\nIn choosing to accept or \\ndecline such projects, the university will weigh the potential of a project for generating', '82 \\n \\n \\nand disseminating new knowledge, for the benefit of society, against the project\\'s \\npotential for adversely affecting the climate for research conducted in a free and open \\nenvironment.\\n\\nWhile this policy sets no explicit limits on the extent of classified research \\npermitted in the semi-autonomous units, it is not the intent of the policy to encourage any \\nunit of the university to engage in classified research as a primary ongoing activity.\\n\\nIndeed, it is expected that classified projects will never represent more than a small \\nfraction of the total research effort in any unit.\\n\\nDefinitions \\n• Research: all projects and investigations involving the creation of new knowledge of a \\ntheoretical or practical nature.\\n\\nThe term \"research\" as used here encompasses both \\n\"research\" and \"development\" as they are commonly defined.\\n\\n• Classified research: research, the free dissemination of the results of which is deemed \\nto jeopardize national security.', '• Classified research: research, the free dissemination of the results of which is deemed \\nto jeopardize national security.\\n\\nThe federal government controls access to the \\nenvironment in which such research is performed, restricts discussions about the work \\nin progress to individuals with clearance and a \"need to know,\" and limits publication \\nof research, results or access to data needed to verify results, for a specified period of \\ntime.\\n\\n• Proprietary research: research that results in intellectual property that is owned by \\nentities other than Carnegie Mellon University.\\n\\nSuch entities may wish to market \\nproducts derived from inventions or ideas that are developed at the university.\\n\\nThey \\nmight, therefore, desire to fund projects which restrict access to data and to \\ndiscussions about work in progress to individuals with a \"need to know,\" and to seek, \\nfor a specified period of time, a delay in publication of research results or data needed \\nto verify results.', 'Such entities may also provide access to proprietary material, which \\nresearchers must agree not to include in publications.\\n\\n• Publication: oral or written dissemination.\\n\\n• Restricted research: includes all classified research, and any proprietary or other \\nresearch that requires more than a six month delay in publication of the research \\nresults.\\n\\n• Semi-autonomous units: units of the university specifically so designated by the \\npresident, after consultation with the URC and the Faculty Senate, currently the Mellon \\nInstitute and the Software Engineering Institute.\\n\\n• Non-autonomous units: all university entities other than semi-autonomous units.', \"83 \\n \\n \\nRestricted Research in Non-Autonomous Units \\nIt is the policy of Carnegie Mellon that restricted research is inappropriate and, therefore, \\nnot permitted within its non-autonomous units.\\n\\nIt is also the policy of Carnegie Mellon not to permit involvement of students in projects \\nwhich carry restrictions that may impede their progress toward a degree.\\n\\nTherefore, \\nstudents should not be involved in contracts that require the delay of a student's \\npublication of research results when such results are intended for use in obtaining \\nacademic credit, except that a sponsor may require a delay of thirty days for review of \\npublications for removal of proprietary information that was provided by the sponsor for \\nthe conduct of the research.\", \"Proprietary research is allowed within non-autonomous units provided it is subject to \\nlimitations (excluding students' publications as noted above) no more stringent than the \\nfollowing: \\n• A sponsor may request a delay of up to six months in publication so that steps may be \\ntaken to secure intellectual property rights to inventions or ideas developed under the \\ncontract.\\n\\n• A sponsor may require a delay of thirty days for review of publications for removal of \\nproprietary information which was provided for the conduct of the research.\\n\\nConsiderations for Faculty/Researchers \\nThe university recognizes that problems arise in both restricted research and research \\nthat is not itself restricted but that involves access to classified or propriety information or \\nmaterials (hereinafter, restricted materials).\\n\\nResearchers may also have access to \\nrestricted materials when serving as consultants.\", \"Researchers may also have access to \\nrestricted materials when serving as consultants.\\n\\nAccess to restricted materials gives rise \\nto concerns about limitations on researchers' freedom to communicate.\\n\\nIn such instances, \\nresearchers must exercise considerable judgment to conduct their research in an open \\nenvironment while protecting the restricted materials to which they have access.\\n\\nResearchers must also be aware that the university will judge their performance as \\nresearchers through their publications or through other scholarly products that arise \\nfrom their research.\\n\\nResearch that is restricted in dissemination, or not available for \\npublic review, cannot be considered in promotion or reappointment decisions or in \\nevaluations of academic performance of any kind.\\n\\nConsiderations for Students \\nThere are important concerns about the involvement of students in restricted research.\\n\\nIt \\nis necessary for students to publish their work in order to obtain degrees, course credit\", \"84 \\n \\n \\nand professional recognition.\\n\\nStudents rely to a large degree on their faculty advisor's \\njudgment for guidance and advice.\\n\\nResearch that is restricted in dissemination, or not \\navailable for public review, cannot be used for academic credit.\\n\\nThus, before working on \\nsuch research, a student must be notified in writing that work on this research may not be \\nused for academic credit.\\n\\nRestricted Research in Semi-Autonomous Units \\nThe semi-autonomous units associated with Carnegie Mellon may conduct restricted \\nresearch.\\n\\nFaculty members may conduct restricted research in or in cooperation with semi-\\nautonomous units only on a consulting basis or by means of a formal, internal leave of \\nabsence from their non-autonomous units.\\n\\nWork that is restricted in any way may not be used for academic evaluations until it is \\nreleased for publication, and then only with respect to future academic actions.\", 'Work that is restricted in any way may not be used for academic evaluations until it is \\nreleased for publication, and then only with respect to future academic actions.\\n\\nStudents may occasionally be employed by the semi-autonomous units, provided that \\nsuch employment does not interfere substantially with progress toward a degree.\\n\\nHowever, they must be made aware that work that is restricted cannot be used for \\nacademic credit.\\n\\nWork that was restricted and is later released for dissemination and \\nreview can be applied toward future academic credit.\\n\\nStudents should be discouraged \\nfrom working on restricted research in which dissemination may be delayed indefinitely.\\n\\nGuidelines for all

error (e.g.\\n\\na clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade \\nor failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who \\nassigned the grade did so in violation of a University policy.', 'A graduate student who believes a final grade was assigned pursuant to (a) or (b) above \\nshould first present the case informally to the faculty or staff member responsible for the \\ncourse in which the student believes an inappropriate grade has been awarded.\\n\\nGrade \\nappeals should be initiated as soon as possible but no later than one year

university values personal and community health and recognizes the critical role that \\neach individual plays in contributing to community health by participating in personal \\nhealth care practices that prevent the spread of contagious diseases.\\n\\nParticipation in a \\nvaccination program represents one such highly effective personal health practice.\\n\\nVaccine-preventable diseases pose a significant threat to the public health of the campus \\ncommunity, impose a significant cost to infected individuals in terms of mortality and \\nmorbidity and impose a cost to other community members by disrupting university life \\nand academic activities.', 'Therefore, the university expects that all individuals will value the \\nimportance of protecting themselves and others by obtaining vaccinations against \\nvaccine-preventable diseases and acknowledges the institution’s role in supporting public \\nhealth by monitoring the vaccination status of incoming students through its policy on \\nimmunization requirements.\\n\\nPolicy Statement \\nThe goal of the university is to provide adequate protection of the campus community \\nagainst vaccine-preventable diseases.\\n\\nThis goal can best be achieved through a \\nprematriculation immunization requirement that is administered by University Health \\nServices (UHS).\\n\\nAll students are required to comply with the immunization requirements \\nand the screening protocol for tuberculosis.', '210 \\n \\n \\nImplementation Guidelines \\nImmunization Requirements for Students \\n• Required vaccinations shall be determined by UHS and shall be consistent with \\nPennsylvania State Law and informed by the recommendations of the American \\nCollege Health Association and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\\n\\n• Vaccination requirements will be reviewed annually by UHS.\\n\\nAny changes in the \\nrequirements effective  in the upcoming school year will be communicated to \\nincoming students and the university community in the spring term prior to \\nimplementation that fall.\\n\\n• Application or modification of this policy for non-Pittsburgh locations will be \\ndetermined by the Director of University Health Services, in consultation with \\nrelevant colleagues in those locations.', 'Additional Requirements for Students Residing in University Housing \\n• Because vaccine preventable diseases spread more readily in a residential \\nenvironment, UHS may set additional requirements for students who elect to live in \\nuniversity housing.\\n\\nRequest for Waiver \\n• A student may request a waiver from any vaccination for medical reasons or if \\nvaccination conflicts with personal or religious beliefs by contacting UHS.\\n\\nIf an \\noutbreak of contagious disease occurs, the university reserves the right to ask \\nstudents who have not been vaccinated against that disease to leave campus until \\nthe outbreak is over.\\n\\nScreening Protocol for Tuberculosis \\n• Students with an increased risk of exposure to tuberculosis are expected to comply \\nwith screening requirements as set forth by UHS and informed by recommendations \\nof the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control.', 'Penalty for Noncompliance \\n• If a student fails to comply with the immunization policy, UHS will notify the University \\nRegistrar who will change the student’s enrollment status to reflect that the student is not \\nenrolled until the requirements are met.', '211 \\n \\n \\n• Additionally, if the student is a resident in university housing and fails to comply with the \\nimmunization requirements, he/she will be removed from housing.\\n\\nA fee may be assessed \\nby Housing for

relieve community members from negative \\neffects of tobacco smoking by others, but also to promote and assist smoking cessation \\nby existing users and discourage new addictions.\\n\\nPolicies that strictly regulate smoking have been demonstrated to reduce exposure to \\nsecond-hand smoke, tobacco-related death and disease, and attendant healthcare costs.\\n\\nIn addition, several systematic reviews of studies have demonstrated effectiveness of \\nsuch policies in reducing the prevalence of tobacco use, increasing the number of tobacco \\nusers who quit, and reducing the initiation of tobacco use among young people.\\n\\nThese \\npositive effects have led leading national health organizations to advocate a smoke-free \\npolicy intervention.', 'These \\npositive effects have led leading national health organizations to advocate a smoke-free \\npolicy intervention.\\n\\nBenchmarking suggests that a “smoke-less” approach, an alternative \\nto prohibition that honors our campus geography and is grounded in sustained and \\nvisible efforts to reduce smoking and promote cessation, can also have positive effects.\\n\\nThe effects of exposure to smoke from tobacco were documented in the 2006, 2010, and \\n2014 U.S.\\n\\nSurgeon General’s Reports.\\n\\nFurther research is needed to determine the public \\nhealth risks and benefits of e-cigarettes and other novel

    "The student handbook is a long PDF file, so we thought cosine similarity would be the most appropriate metric. This is because cosine similarity measures the similarity between two vectors regardless of their magnitudes, focusing only on the direction – this is effective for files of large length such as in this case, and makes it robust to differences in document lengths. Cosine similarity metric is also commonly used in NLP tasks such as information retrieval. Since this common use case is similar to our own of reading and answering queries based on a text, we thought it would be a good fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison, dot product uses both magnitude and direction of vectors as opposed to only using direction. This means that the result can be skewed by irrelevant details. For instance, in a situation like this, where we are working with text-based data, the construction of an NLP model where vectors may represent frequencies of words can skew results. Dot product directly multiplies the frequency of each word in the vectors, potentially amplifying the importance of frequent words and leading to skewed results. Meanwhile, Euclidean distance is also not as intuitive for interpreting similarity as cosine similarity. While smaller distances generally indicate greater similarity, the absolute values are not directly comparable across different pairs of passages, making it challenging to assess similarity comprehensively.\n"

This is because with a 'k' value of 10, the responses contained detailed and relevant information from the CMU Student Handbook, focusing on CMU's quiet hours. This parameter strikes a balance between breadth and depth - a smaller 'k' value might not capture enough information to fully answer the query, while a larger 'k' might retrieve too much information, making it harder to identify the most relevant details. The 'k' of 10 provided a focused yet comprehensive overview, making it the best choice for these queries. This suggests that for detailed documents or specific queries, a moderate 'k' value efficiently balances comprehensiveness and relevance."

Based on the responses to the queries provided, it seems the 'k' parameter set to 5 and 10 retrieved the highest quality/most accurate result. For queries that are very specific or require detailed information, a higher 'k' value might be beneficial because it retrieves more candidate responses, increasing the chance of finding accurate and relevant information. On the other hand, for broader queries or when seeking a general overview, a lower 'k' value might suffice and even be preferable, as it focuses on the most relevant results without overwhelming the user with too much or too specific information.\n",
